<h2>HCA UI Programmer Doumentation</h2>
<i>Fry started June 7, 2021</i>

<h3>Other libraries</h3>
With a wide web search, I seriously considered 2 other JavaScript libraries
before choosing LiteGraph.

<h4>Node-Red</h4>
node-red npm pacckage made by IBM for user friendly IOT "wiring".<br/>
Lots of work into this project. <br/>
Good video tutorials, etc, <br/>
BUT only supports one input per node.<br/>
(It does mave multiple outputs).<br/>
node-red is, I'm guessing by far the biggest library.
It probably has a lot we don't need in it.
I'm not so concerned about app size, but rather,
to understand the parts you need, you have to
wade through a lot of code.

<h4>Rete</h4>
https://rete.js.org/  js, npm, better doc. JSON object storage.<br/>
Support for a 'DOCK" (I GUESS PALLETE.)<br/>
But DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT SUPPORTS Nested nodes like litegraph.
Has significantly more downloads than litegraph,
but litegraph still has a significant amount.

<h3>LiteGraph</h3>
Litegraph is a library for interactively making boxes and arrows graphs.

Fry's notes from reading that file:

<h4>LiteGraph.Nodes</h4>
<pre>
A node is the graphical representation of a HCA object.
LiteGraph.Nodes {} name-value pairs of the built in nodes. Excludes my designed nodes.
LiteGraph.registered_node_types  {} name-value pairs of the built in  and custom nodes
HCA.lgraph._nodes an array of all node instances installed in mny lgraph
HCA.lgraph._nodes_in_order  an array of all the nodes
HCA.lgraph._nodes_in_order[0] the first node
HCA.lgraph._nodes_in_order[0].is_selected //true or false
HCA.lgraph.remove(node)

HCA.lgraph.clear() //remove all nodes
HCA.lgraph.start()
HCA.lgraph.stop()
HCA.lgraph.runStep(number_of_steps_to_run)
HCA.lgraph.arrange(margin_in_pixels) //I guess auto-layout!
HCA.lgraph.getNodeById(id)
HCA.lgraph.addGlobalInput(...)
HCA.lgraph.addOutput(...) //global output
HCA.lgraph.serialize() //makes a json object of all the data in this lgraph
HCA.lgraph.configure(json_string, keep_old_boolean) //Configure a graph from a JSON string
HCA.lgraph._groups  a array, initially empty.


LiteGraph.NODE_sizes and colors for the box, fonts, etc.
LiteGraph.NODE_DEFAULT_BGCOLOR = "#353535"

LiteGraph.createNode(type, // "basic/const"
title,
options)
new LiteGraph.Subgraph() //I guess
LiteGraph.registered_node_types  {} key value pairs of the string type  a la "basic/const" and val of its constructor fn.
about 200 of them including "basic/boolean" "basic/string" "basic/script" "events/delay"
"graph/Subgraph" (can probably use this to make a subgraph.
"input/gamepad"

LiteGraph.wrapFunctionAsNode: Æ’ ( name, func, param_types, return_type, properties )

NODES:
slot means a non-neg int that refers to a specific input or output in the node,
i.e. an index into the array that represents inputs or outputs.

properties are user-defined name-value pairs with some extra info.
LGraphNode.prototype.addProperty = function(name, default_value, type, extra_info)
Get a prop value with:
LGraphNode.prototype.id LGraphNode.prototype.properities[name]
Set a prop vslue with:
LGraphNode.prototype.id LGraphNode.prototype.properities[name] = new_val

LGraphNode.prototype.flags.collapsed   (boolean)
LGraphNode.prototype.serialize() returns JSON obj.
LGraphNode.prototype.clone = function()
LGraphNode.prototype.addWidget = function( type, name, value, callback, options )
LGraphNode.prototype.alignToGrid = function()

LGraphNode.prototype.trace = function(msg)   Console output
LGraphNode.prototype.loadImage = function(url) //umm could I make a real AND gate?
//loads the image from LiteGraph.node_images_path but
//doesn't look like it displays this image anywhere nor in the node itself.

LGraphNode.prototype.collapse = function(force)
</pre>
<h4>Groups</h4>
<pre>
HCA.lgraph._groups  a array, initially empty.
function LGraphGroup(title)
new LiteGraph.LGraphGroup("mytitle")  //make a group.
HCA.lgraph.add(new LiteGraph.LGraphGroup("mytit"))  //add new group to grpah, it shows with title
you can drag the lower right cornder of the group rect to exand or contract it.
You can drop a node in a group, then drag teh group and it keeps the node in the group.
You can drag a node and drop it inside the group
</pre>

<h4>LGraphCanvas</h4>
<pre>
This is NOT the dom elt for the "canvas" tag, which I store in HCA_canvas_id
But you can get all the canvases from HCA.lgraph.list_of_graphcanvas
and to get the first one, HCA.lgraph.list_of_graphcanvas[0]
HCA.lgraph.list_of_graphcanvas[0].canvas === HCA_canvas_id

LGraphCanvas.link_type_colors
LGraphCanvas.prototype.getTopGraph()
LGraphCanvas.prototype.openSubgraph = function(graph)  // opens a graph contained inside a node in the current graph
LGraphCanvas.prototype.closeSubgraph = function()
LGraphCanvas.prototype.getCurrentGraph = function()

LGraphCanvas.prototype.deleteSelectedNodes = function() //cut
LGraphCanvas.prototype.copyToClipboard  //copy
LGraphCanvas.prototype.pasteFromClipboard = function()  //paste

LGraphCanvas.prototype.selected_nodes   //an array.
LGraphCanvas.prototype.processNodeDblClicked = function(n)
LGraphCanvas.prototype.selectNode = function(node, add_to_current_selection)

LGraphCanvas.prototype.setZoom = function(value=1, zooming_center)
LGraphCanvas.prototype.drawNodeWidgets = function(node, posY, ctx,active_widget)
doesn't draw an img but maybe shows the way to do it.
LGraphCanvas.prototype.drawGroups = function(canvas, ctx)
Lots of menu methods in here but no obvious create menu, show menu
LGraphCanvas.onShowPropertyEditor = function(item, options, e, menu, node) //???properties editor?
LGraphCanvas.prototype.prompt = function(title, value, callback, event, multiline) {
LGraphCanvas.prototype.showSearchBox = function(event) {
LGraphCanvas.prototype.createDialog = function(html, options)
LGraphCanvas.prototype.createPanel = function(title, options)
LGraphCanvas.prototype.showShowNodePanel = function( node ) //what's this ???
LGraphCanvas.prototype.showSubgraphPropertiesDialog = function(node)

LGraphCanvas.onMenuNodeToSubgraph = function(value, options, e, menu, node)
LGraphCanvas.prototype.getCanvasMenuOptions = function()
LGraphCanvas.prototype.getNodeMenuOptions = function(node)//called by processContextMenu to extract the menu list
LGraphCanvas.prototype.getGroupMenuOptions = function(node)

right click menu:
function ContextMenu(values, //(allows object { title: "Nice text", callback: function ... })
options) {
LGraphCanvas.prototype.processMouseDown = function(e) {
get e.which  of 3, and is not read_only but
since this.onMouseDown  is undefined, does not call it. Presumably that's what pops up the menu.
this is LGraphCanvas.prototype.
The only onMouseDown def is for CurveEditor,
but LGraphCanvas.prototype.bindEvents = function() binds mouseDown to
LGraphCanvas.prototype.canvas
Trying to get pop up menu on a node.


//drawing a node.
LGraphCanvas.prototype.drawNode(node, ctx); c
which draws links, inputs, outputs,
and calls LGraphCanvas.prototype.drawNodeShape(node, ctx,size,color,bgcolor,
node.is_selected,node.mouseOver)
extra stuff can be drawn if the user defines:
LGraphNode.prototype.onDrawForeground
with some help via node.onDrawCollapsed(ctx, this)
node.onDrawForeground(ctx, this, this.canvas)  (and note that the default value
for onDrawForeground is null, in which case this is not called.
onDrawBackground: render the background area inside the node (only in edit mode)
But most of the node is drawn by drawNodeShape(node, ...),
unfortunate because I'd have to hack this monster fn to special case
its node arg to, say draw an image in place of the other svg draw fns.

LGraphCanvas.prototype.drawNode(node, ctx) calls
node.onDrawForeground(ctx, this, this.canvas); where this is
an GraphCanvas.prototype, with a field mouse whose value is
an array of 2 floats ie [234.4 125.6]

<h4>Questions</h4>
<pre>
You can write any feedback to javi.agenjo@gmail.com
???More complete doc somewhere?
???example of an app using many features of this library?
https://tamats.com/projects/litegraph/editor/
https://tamats.com is Javi's website.
???Cut/copy/paste keystrokes fail. Is there a way to interactively delete a node?
???double click on graph background displays Search type-in but typing in "and"
creates the node "Rand" not my node "and" which is registered.
???click on group does not highlight/select it.
???relationship of subgraph and group?
??? how to create subgraphs, expand and shrink them.
???How to bring up context menu on click right (on background, node, group)


??? How to make a node be rendered as a small image, like and AND gate with input and output circles?
From: https://github.com/jagenjo/litegraph.js/tree/master/guides
ou can draw something inside a node using the callbacks onDrawForeground and onDrawBackground. The only difference is that onDrawForeground gets called in Live Mode and onDrawBackground not.
Both functions receive the Canvas2D rendering context and the LGraphCanvas instance where the node is being rendered.
You do not have to worry about the coordinates system, (0,0) is the top-left corner of the node content area (not the title).
node.onDrawForeground = function(ctx, graphcanvas)
{
if(this.flags.collapsed)
return;
ctx.save();
ctx.fillColor = "black";
ctx.fillRect(0,0,10,this.size[1]);
ctx.restore();
}
