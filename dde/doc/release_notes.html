 <details class="doc_details"><summary>v 4.1.2, Jun 17, 2023</summary>
     Highlights: Just fixes some build bugs.
 </details>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 4.1.1, Jun 16, 2023</summary>
    Highlights: GPT extensions esp. for aiding programming. 2 Python fixes.
<ul>
    <li>Talk: fixed the communications bug.</li>
    <li>Python: choosing the command line language of Python now automatically initializes Python.</li>
    <li>Python: command line language of "Python" fixed to print out the result of evaling typed in Python code.</li>
    <li>TestSuite, Ref Man, GPT: Several "code" examples for GPT prompts were not excluded from the TestSuite but should have been. Now they are.</li>
    <li>GPT: before your first use, if you didn't change the response media, you will get an error. Now fixed. Defaults to "text".</li>
    <li>GPT: extension of <code>OpenAI.recursive</code> to take an additional simpler syntax and give better output, especially for two word responses.</li>
    <li>GPT configuration dialog. Now when you click on a different model, it will automatically rerun the previous prompt in that new model.
    <li>Output pane header check box "code" now converts the last output to code or not code.
         Works with GPT output as well. Very useful for HTML.</li>
    <li>GPT: configuration dialog has a new button, <input type="button" value="regenerate"/></li>
    <li>GPT: configuration dialog as 2 new "response media":<br/>
        <b>Insert into Editor:</b> "code_only" and "whole-response".
        If "code_only" doesn't find any code, but does find a number, it inserts it.
        If it finds more than one number, it inserts an array of them.</li>
    <li>GPT: improved doc, esp. for Programming Languages. SVG and ASCII Art examples added.</li>
    <li>GPT: HTML/CSS class "gpt" added for the background color light green in Ref Man examples.
        The same color used for GPT prompt and response in Output pane.
         This class is also looked at when running all testsuites to NOT run GPT examples, in
         case user doesn't have OpenAI account or is not Internet connected.</li>
    <li>GPT: new command line language: "GPT". Select it in the Output pane header, type in text
        in the command line, hit ENTER and its a GPT request.</li>
    <li>GPT: new simplified architecture for switching between various response media.</li>
    <li>GPT: a couple of examples in the Doc now have "with URLs" as a suffix.
        The response comes back with URLs that are now wrapped in A tags so you can click on them to browse them.
        Now its easier to verify (or not) that the prose is correct.
        But many of the URLs are "not found",
        and some are not exactly relevant to the precise topic.
        At least its easy to determine by looking at the URL's page's title and abstract.</li>
    <li>GPT: Before your first use, if you didn't change the response media,
        you would get an error. Now fixed. Defaults to "text".</li>
    <li>GPT: configuration dialog. Now when you click on a different model,
        it will automatically rerun the previous prompt in that new model.</li>
    <li>GPT text_to_data now extends "code" found with a new call to "out" after
        every call to console.log, passing it the same argument.
        This makes testing evaluated code using "code_only" insertion
        into editor easier than looking in the Chrome console.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 4.1.0, Jun 5, 2023</summary>
 Highlights: Job Engine in DDE4 showstopper bug fixed.
    Can now use later than node 17.
    GPT: gpt-4 model now supported plus more extensions.
    <ul>
        <li>For File menu, local save, got rid of the need for the
         user to click an extra "choose" button.</li>
        <li>Fixed Job Engine launch bug of "LongBits"
            error printed in output pane.</li>
        <li>Now able to run with latest node version: now tested with node v20.2.0</li>
        <li>GPT <code>OpenAI.text_to_data</code>'s result now contains word_count, first_setentence, prompt, result</li>
        <li>GPT new function: <code>OpenAI.make_plot_numbers</code></li>
        <li>GPT new function: <code>OpenAI.move_dexter_joints</code></li>
        <li>GPT 4 now supported as a model</li>
        <li>GPT's Configuration dialog box is much more interactive now because clicking on a media type,
            image size, or updating max_tokens
            causes it to show without a new OpenAI request (if possible).</li>
        <li>GPT new response medias: plot_numbers, inspect_text_to_data</li>
     </ul>
     </details>
 <details class="doc_details"><summary>v 4.0.11, May 31, 2023</summary>
Highlights: GPT extensions for doc, programmatic interface, AI examples.
<ul>
     <li>When clicking eval button, a spurious ending comma is removed.
         This helps with evaling Job instructions and other intermediate
         snippets of code. A message is printed in the console to
         let you know this has been done. If it is NOT done, you'd get an error.</li>
    <li>GPT configuration dialog box: improved links and tooltips.</li>
    <li>GPT: new user callable <code>OpenAI.make_text</code> function.</li>
    <li>GPT: lots more programmatic interface extensions including

        NLP, similarity, analogical reasoning.</li>
    <li>GPT implemented <code>OpenAI.create_embedding(text)</code>
        for making an embedding from a string programmatically.</li>
    <li><code>GPT OpenAI.similar()</code> returns a number
        between -1 and 1 for two strings.</li>
    <li>GPT config dialog box: now has show/hide for the org and API key
        for "password protection".</li>
    <li><code>Utils.is_array_of_numbers</code> extended to take new args:
        length, min, max <i>and</i> consider that <code>Number.NaN</code>
        is NOT a number.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 4.0.10, May 22, 2023</summary>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 4.0.6, Apr 14, 2023</summary>
    Build problem
</details>

         <details class="doc_details"><summary>v 4.0.5, Feb  21, 2023</summary>
 Highlights: DDE4 uses a very different deployment strategy than DDE3. DDE4 is served
    from an HTTP server running on Dexter. You connect your computer to Dexter and
    use a browser (Chrome is the most tested) to browse: "192.168.1.142"
    and you'll get a page that contains
    different applications that can be served included DDE4 and the Job Engine.
    <p></p>
    Clicking on DDE4 gives you an IDE very much like DDE3.
    CLicking on the Job Engine gives you a web page that is the Job Engine user interface.
    <p></p>
    Below are just *some* of the changes since DDE4. This quite incomplete.
    Also, the base source code of DDE4 split off from DDE3 in 2021.
    The improvements to DDE3 done since then that are relevant to DDE4 were incorporated
    into DDE4, but no release notes were made for those improvements in DDE4's release notes,
    just because there were so many moving parts.
    <ul>
        <li>DDE4 is using a new speech recognition engine: Speechly. This is not yet documented.</li>
        <li>In the node server fixed: <code>compute_dde_apps_folder()</code> by removing slash on end of returned path.</li>
        <li>Previously <code>Dexter.dexter0</code> was not the same as  <code>Dexter.default</code>  on start_up. Now it is.
            Also <code>Dexter.dexter0</code> always has an ip address at startup.</li>
        <li>Fixed bug in <code>to_source_code</code> in the argument when calling to_source_code_lit_obj.</li>
        <li>In job.js, in <code>to_source_code</code>, removed the clause that removes the last do_list instr if its a "g".
            This is no longer automatically added.</li>
        <li>Fixed/extended <code>to_source_code</code> for the instructions in instructions_dexter.js</li>
        <li>Fixes to <code>to_source_code</code> for jobs and arrays.</li>
        <li>If <code>Job.job_id_to_job_instance</code> is passed a string,
            it is converted to an integer before using it.</li>
        <li>Fix to <code>Instruction.to_string</code> to work for undefined and
            null instructions.</li>
        <li><code>Convert.deep_copy</code> fixed to handle null and undefined.</li>
        <li>Kin.js replaced <code>Dexter.Link1</code> thru 5,  with <code>Dexter.defaults.LinkLength</code>
            and commented out  robot.js <code>Dexter.prototype.set_link_lengths_from_file_content</code>
            which is no longer being called but used Dexter.Link1 thru 5.</li>
        <li><code>Job.next_do_list_item</code> fixed calling of <code>if_instruction_error</code> by placing
            it directly on do_list and fixing test suite item to place
            <code>Control.stop_job</code> rather than <code>Control.stop_job()</code> as the value of
            <code>if_instruction_error</code> in the Job's parameters.</li>
        <li>Fixed bug in <code>get_file_async</code> that was on the server.
            Note that dde4 <code>DDEFile.get_file_async</code> takes a callback function
            that takes just 2 args, err and content whereas dde3 get_file_async's
            callback took 3 args, err, response_obj, content.
            The dde4 file system functions callbacks all follow the convention of
            taking 2 args, err, and content.</li>
        <li>HCA_UI: fixed remaining 2 bugs in parsing .idl files.</li>
        <li>dxf fixed  <code>extrusionDirection = parsePoint();</code> to
            <code>entity.extrusionDirection = parsePoint();</code></li>
        <li>In txt.js, fixed <code>return points = [ ...]</code></li>
        <li>Fix for <code>Dexter.prototype.defaults_high_level_to_defaults_lines_ServoSetup_line</code>
            about duplicate <code>RebootServo</code> written out to
            <code>defaults.make_ins</code>.</li>
        <li>In <code>Editor.save_current_file</code>, if there is no current_file, then don't attempt to save it,
               which would cause a bug.</li>
        <li>Changed <code>Websockets port</code> for connecting to Dexter from 50000 to 3000,
            both ide and job engine.</li>
        <li>New Utils set functions:
            <code>difference</code>, <code>symmetric_difference</code>, <code>union</code>,
            <code>de_duplicate</code>.
                Already existing: <code>insersection</code>.</li>
        <li>New Utils method: <code>subarray</code> to have a working <code>splice</code> functionality.</li>
        <li>Extended <button>Eval</button> button to not error when passed a valid
             <code>JSON</code> object starting with <code>{</code>
            but instead does <code>JSON.parse</code> on it and inspects the result.</li>
        <li>Added the npm package <code>compromise</code> under the <code>globalThis.nlp</code> for
            natural language processing utilities.</li>
        <li>Added <code>job_process on error</code> handler to robustify the server in httpd.mjs.</li>
        <li>In <code>Dexter.prototype.defaults_read</code> in the callback it defines,
            in its CATCH clause, after the warning call, added the call to<br/>
            <code>if (callback) { callback.call(the_dex_inst, null)} </code><br/>
           so that it will "continue on" even when we have to default the parsing of
            <code>Defaults.makeins</code>.</li>
        <li>Added to <code>DDE_DB.persistent_values_initial_object</code>
            <code>"dexter_default_ip_address": "192.168.1.142"</code>.</li>
        <li>Fixed <code>Socket.instruction_array_arcseconds_to_degrees_maybe</code>
            for the <code>JointDH</code> clause to return
            <code>instruction_array_copy</code> instead of undefined.</li>
        <li>Editor pane header now includes a "view menu" containing JS and HCA.
           HCA is a new in-DDE blocks and wires editor for creating FPGA applications.
           It is not ready for actual use yet, but can be played with to help us
           make this into a useful tool.</li>
</ul>

        usually be called instead.</li>
    <li>Now the simulator <b>both</b> option works.
       The simulator is about 10% faster or so than the <b>real</b> Dexter.
       Needs some work to get real dexter and sim in sync.</li>
    <li>Dexter UI: fixed a problem when you:<br/>
        1. launch DDE<br/>
        2. start Dexter UI<br/>
        3. uncheck the point down check box.<br/>
        It use to move Dexter into a bad configuration.
        Now it doesn't move Dexter at all (which is correct).</li>
    <li>Removed <i>Jobs menu/Run Instruction/PARKED_ANGLES</i>
        not useful and if Dexter is
         uncalibrated, it may run into itself.</li>
    <li>When you choose Jobs menu/<b>Dexter UI</b>,
       a warning message is printed that Dexter
        will move when you use this dialog box.</li>
    <li> <b>Dexter UI</b> tutorial improved slightly with a warning that Dexter will move.</li>
    <li>Fixed <code>Dexter.pid_move_to</code> to properly set up the passed in robot.</li>
    <li>Fixed <code>Job.send</code> when an oplet array is passed in that has a
        robot instance as its last element.</li>
    <li>Fixed Dexter <b>simulator</b> such that when simulating a PID move,
       and the simulator is not actually showing, it doesn't attempt to draw to it.</li>
    <li><b>Make Instruction</b>: twisting down the "Recording" arrow automatically scrolls
        the doc pane to documentation specific to Recording.</li>
    <li>Improved the doc for <b>Make Instruction's record</b> facility.</li>
    <li>Make Instruction record:
        fixes to controls for play, stepping and dragging the "play head" circle.</li>
    <li>Make Instruction record: insert now uses a new Brain robot for the high
        level Job so that we don't have 2 Jobs with the same default robot.</li>
    <li>Make Instruction record: clicking insert now does NOT pop up a dialog of
       options. Smarter analysis and insertion plus easer-to-understand functionality
       now make this unnecessary.</li>
    <li>Make Instruction record: clicking "record button" sets visible form's do_list
        to [] so user knows we're starting a new recording.</li>
    <li>Make Instruction insertion of trailing commas improved.</li>
    <li><code>Dexter.set_follow_me</code>, <code>force_protect</code>,
        <code>open_loop</code> and <code>keep_position</code> instructions
         now work for J6 and J7. Useful in Make Instruction record.</li>
    <li>Now there's an explicit warning for user clicking on the <button>Eval</button> button
          when only whitespace is selected.
          This can occur when user inserts a recording with a high level Job.</li>
    <li><b>Inspect</b> fixed for an edge case of inspecting 2D arrays.</li>
    <li>Ref Man/Job/Definition Time vs Run Time tweaked and greatly extended with a
          new sub-section: <b>Simplified Jobs Model</b>.
          Recommended reading if you really want to understand what Jobs are all about.</li>
    <li>Added to <b>Job engine</b> from regular DDE:<br/>
        <code>file_exists</code>, <code>is_folder</code>, <code>persistent_get</code>,
        <code>persistent_remove</code>, <code>persistent_save</code>,
        <code>make_folder</code></li>
    <li>new function: <code>append_to_file</code>
         See Ref Man/IO/File Access/append_to_file.
        Also in the Job Engine.</li>
    <li><code>get_page_async</code> now available in the Job engine.
        Doc improved at RefMan/IO/web/get_page_async</li>
    <li>Job engine index.js, <code>run_node_command</code> improved eval call to make <code>require</code> calls work.</li>
    <li>Fixed click help on a file name (path)</li>
    <li>Fixed <code>read_file_async</code> when reading a file with a defaulting folder
        name and we're reading from Dexter. This also fixes <code>copy_file_async</code>
         when copying from Dexter to DDE.</li>
    <li>Added an example to Ref Man/IO/File Access/copy_file_async for
        copying to a Dexter.</li>
    <li>DDE splitter-bar width increased from 5px to 8px to make dragging them easier.</li>
    <li><b>Jobs menu/Eval & Start Job</b>: if you select instructions to run NOT in a Job definition,
        a Job will be defined (as usual).
        But now, such defined Jobs will use the Dexter.default
        (selected in the Misc pane header.</li>
    <li>Jobs menu/Eval & Start Job now functionality better matches
        User Guide/User Interface/Editor Pane/Eval & Start Job menu item.</li>
    <li>File menu new item: Load and start Job... that lets you choose a file.
       It is loaded, and the first job in it (if any) is started.
         Particularly useful for demos.</li>
    <li><b>Simulator</b>: fixed to not attempt to display J6 & J7 movement if the simulator
        is not showing.</li>
    <li>Simulator controls for rotating Dexter improved.</li>
    <li>Simulator  Middle button/scroll_wheel down is now an additional way to pan,
        from the existing alt/option key down.</li>
    <li>Improved <code>Socket.on_receive</code> to take the Dexter instance as an argument
        rather than compute it,
       (somewhat heuristically) from a robot_status. More reliable, less code.</li>
    <li>Ref Man/Robot/Robot Instructions/<code>Control/break</code> extended to include
        an example of having an inner loop break out of an outer loop.</li>
    <li>Jobs menu item <b>Run Job on Dexter</b> fixed to work not just when
        you choose the menu item, but then click the Job button created to run the
        Job a 2nd (or 3rd ...) time. Improved the tooltip for the menu item.</li>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 3.7.18, Jun 30, 2021</summary>
Highlights: New Job Param: when_do_list_done. Error system clean-up. Make Instrunction bugs fixed.
 New programmatic interface to versioned files.
<ul>
    <li><code>FileTransfer.customize_defaults_make_ins</code> def extended to
        have comments describing its inputs.</li>
    <li>Ref Man <code>choose_file</code> has a new example for choosing a folder.</li>
    <li><code>choose_file</code> doc improved.</li>
    <li><code>Simqueue.render_instruction</code> fixed warning message for job name.</li>
    <li><code>make_full_path</code> now documented in Ref Man/IO/File System/make_full_path</li>
    <li>Now, if you attempt to redefine a job while it is running, you will get a warning
        message telling you to explicitly stop the job before redefining it.
        This should lead to less surprising behavior and put the user in control if
        they accidentally attempt to re-define a job while its running.</li>
    <li>Fixed error handling in simulator for oplets "e" and "r".</li>
    <li>In <code>Dexter.robot_done_with_instruction</code> improved error handling for
        invalid job_id.</li>
    <li>In <code>Dexter.robot_done_with_instruction</code>, now set the robot's
         robot_status property earlier so its available for error cases.</li>
    <li>Improved <code>Job.prototype.rs_to_error_message</code> to show the error code if
        there's a robot_status error.</li>
    <li>In Make Instruction pane, fixed the "run" button for both simulator and real.</li>
    <li>Job parameters: new: <code>when_do_list_done</code>
         indicates action when the do_list as compeltely run.
         The existing <code>when_stopped</code> can no longer take a "wait" value,
         but you can obtain that effect by giving when_do_list_done a "wait" value.
         This makes it possible to have some 'clean up' code when a Job is finished but
         also allow a "wait" for additional instructions.</li>
    <li>Error system cleanup improving instructions: <code>Control.stop_job</code>,
         <code>Control.error</code>,
         and Job params: <code>if_instruction_error</code>, <code>if_robot_status_error</code>,
                 <code>if_dexter_connection_error</code>.</li>
    <li><code>get_latest_path</code> and <code>make_unique_path</code> for programmatically
      managing versioned files. See Ref man/IO/File Access/get_latest_path .</li>
</ul>

    <li>Fixed 2 bugs in <code>Socket.instruction_array_degrees_to_arcseconds_maybe</code>
    S params affecting calibration. one for "J*Boundary*"
    and one for "CommandedAngles", "RawEncoderErrorLimits", "RawVelocityLimits".</li>
    <li>Improved error message for <code>Job.prototype.if_robot_status_error_default</code>
    when it can't get the errors.log file from Dexter.</li>
    <li>New Function under <code>FileTransfer</code> extended for customize_defaults_make_ins.
        This functionality not yet documented.</li>
    <li>HCA: Added cut, copy, paste keystroke commands to the network editor.
        This functionality is not yet documented or generally useful.

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 3.7.16, Jun 10, 2021</summary>
Highlights: Improvements to simulation and Dexter UI esp. for pid moves.
 UpdateFirmware facility improved. Gameification for educational motivation added.
<ul>
    <li>Improved inspector for large 2D arrays:
      if there is more than 6 columns (or 10 rows),
      do not auto-expand the table in the inspector.</li>
   <li>First easter egg added</li>
    <li>New Misc pane sub-pane: Reward Board showing usage statistics and magic spells.</li>
    <li>FileTransfer.get_releases_page_callback fixed bug in call to decrypt_file
    that prevented sending files to Dexter.</li>
    <li>Uninstalled npm f4st-crypt (not used, using node's cryto instead.)</li>
    <li>Changed Jobs/Dexter Tools/Browse Dexter default to Jobs/Dexter Tools/Browse Dexter,
        to make it shorter and fit on one line of menu.</li>
    <li>Click help on a Job parameter now gives you an underlined blue link
    in the Output pane that you can click on and see the doc for that particular param.</li>
    <li>Dexter UI dialog box: new tooltips on the "donut" and the green dot to tell
        you their meanings.</li>
    <li>Uninstalled ml-classify-text.  Not used.</li>
    <li>Uninstalled zeromq package. No longer used.</li>
    <li>New Click help for <code>dexter</code> about Dexter and <code>Dexter.dexter0</code></li>
    <li><code>Dexter.prototype.is_direction</code> and <code>Kin.is_direction</code>
    methods added.</li>
    <li><code>Dexter.HOME_ANGLES</code> changed from [0,0,0,0,0,0,0] to [0,0,0,0,0,0,50] .
    If you move J7 to 0 it will likely overtorque when you have a parallel gripper on Dexter
    but by setting J7 to 50 and it won't overtorque.</li>
    <li>Reboot_joints job now uses brain robot so it can be used while Dexter UI job is running.</li>
    <li>load_job_engine.js:  exported and included about 10 fns from html_db.js</li>
    <li>Fixed bug in click help for <code>Js_info.get_info_string</code></li>

    <li>Fixes to Dexter UI dialog, and simulator around pid moves.</li>
    <li> Dexter instruction <code>read_file</code> now does not attempt to put ANY prefix on the front
    of the path passed in. If its starts with a letter,
     it will get a file in /srv/samba/share/</li>
    <li>Robot status array for g0 for simulator now returns "angle" for J1 thru J5.</li>
    <li>Fixed bug in click help for Date instance methods like <code>getHours</code>.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 3.7.15, May 25, 2021</summary>
Highlights: Improvements to Jobs sending instructions to Dexter, esp.
            instructions that include a Dexter instance as their subject.
            Robot Status dialog now allows you to select the status mode (g number)
            displayed by "run rs_update job".
            Serial port, Make Instruction, Editor, doc improvements.
<ul>
    <li>Socket on error fixed bug of it not stopping the job when it should.</li>
    <li>Serial port: fixed numerous small problems including with serial_connect_low_level
        and serial_disconnect.</li>
    <li>Editor click-help Fixed infinite loop in some cases of clicking on the comment // .</li>
    <li>Editor click-help Fixed testing for end of /* and */ comments.</li>
    <li>Run Instruction dialog box: for the "mode" select box,
         the blank item now has a tooltip telling you not to select it,
         but if you do, you get a nice warning message instead of an error.</li>
    <li>Improved Ref Man/IO/File Access/ <code>read_file</code> and <code>write_file</code> for "encoding" parameter.</li>
    <li>Improved doc for <code>read_file</code> and <code>write_file</code>.</li>
    <li>Fixed bug in util: <code>is_generator_function</code> to correctly handling args
         passed of undefined, 0, null, false. This fixes a bug in the inspector when
         inspecting Jobs.</li>
    <li>Fixed similar bug in <code>is_iterator</code> .</li>
    <li><code>Dexter.set_link_lengths_using_node_server</code>
         now uses a timeout of 1 second so it will error quickly if there's no Dexter connected.</li>
    <li>Make Instruction: Now, clicking on "wrap in Job" button no longer scrolls doc to Job so
         that you don't lose doc on the inst you're wrapping,
         and makes it possible to follow the ref man tutorial.</li>
    <li>Make Instruction: updated User Guide for "Insert a Job" to "Wrap in Job."</li>
    <li>Make Instructions Insert Job dialog box, clicking the "insert" button,
         now closes the dialog box.</li>
    <li>Fixed <code>Instruction.text_for_do_list_item</code> to protect against circular printing,
          that happens sometimes in inspecting dl_list items.</li>
    <li>Made <code>folder_listing</code> accessible in the Job Engine.</li>
    <li>Now if there is an active job who's robot is a particular Dexter,
        and you start a 2nd job who's robot is that same particular dexter,
        the 2nd job will error.
        We now don't allow more than one active job to have the same dexter as its Dexter.</li>
    <li>Improvements to Dexter instructions that give a robot instance as their subject,
      ie <code>Dexter.dexter0.move_all_joints(...)</code>,
        <code>Dexter.dexter0.sleep(...)</code>.
      Using this mechanism, you can send an instruction from a job that doesn't
      have that Dexter instance as its job, to that dexter.</li>
    <li>Robot status dialog now allows you to select the status mode to be retrieved and
         shown when you click the "run update job' button, Other minor improvements to the dialog.</li>
    <li>Inspector: when passed a 2D array, it only "auto-expands it"
        if it has 10 pr fewer rows.
        This works on nested object & arrays, making it easier to see the high level structure
        of the data, but then click to see details of some part that you really care about.</li>
    <li>Fixed spelling recieve => receive in numerous doc and error messages. </li>
    <li><code>Job.prototype.send</code> now doesn't modify array instructions by popping off
       the robot on the end of a sent array,
       so that the do_list preserves the robot in it for use
       by Socket.find_dexter_instance_from_robot_status.</li>
</ul>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 3.7.12, Apr 23, 2021</summary>
Highlights: zeromq npm package re-installed, serial port and Dexter UI dialog tweaks.
<ul>
    <li>npm zeromq package installed version 6.0.0-beta:</li>
    <li>serial port: <code>old serial_path_to_info_map</code> is now defined to be same
        as the new <code>serial_port_path_to_info_map</code>,
        but <code>serial_path_to_info_map</code> is deprecated.</li>
    <li>serial port: <code>serial_connect_low_level</code> has a new last arg: <code>close_callback</code>
        that defaults to a callback fn that just prints out that the port has been closed.</li>
    <li>Dexter UI dialog box: improvements to underlying layout html and css.</li>

<ul>
    <li>Lots of internal changes to Job and socket handling.
    Restriction of only 1 active job per robot.
    New status_code of <code>"stopping"</code> for handling jobs with <code>"F"</code>
    instructions that are stopped
    by user before the <code>"F"</code> instruction acknowledgement comes back from Dexter.
    Socket informal code to close socket now all call <code>Socket.close()</code>.
    Some calls to close now are passed true, to force close of the socket,
    ie when socket errors.</li>
    <li>No longer using  <code>Dexter.set_link_lengths_using_job</code>.
         This method is slow, unreliable and causes another job to be launched during
         the running of a job, which was confusing, and now not permitted with the
         new socket architecture.</li>
</ul>

    <li>Fixed the DDE Dexter settings such that if you start up DDE in real mode, and the "link lengths"
    (and min & max joint angles) are retrieved from defaults.makeins,
    but that file does not have min and max values for J6 and J7 (they don't now),
    then use default values for them.
    This fixes a bug in the Dexter UI sliders for J6 & J7 max values.</li>
    <li><code>J6_ANGLE_MIN</code> is now -150 (was 0).  <code>J6_ANGLE_MAX</code> is now 150 (was 296)</li>
    <li>Manage NPM, the help for creating the "require" code now has var names
        with hyphens changed to underscores to match JS syntax for var names.</li>

        into the Manage npm dialog box.</li>
    <li>New Method: <code>DDE_NPM.is_installed</code>.
        See RefMan/Add Javascript/DDE_NPM.is_installed.</li>
    <li><code>DDE_NPM.uninstall</code> now won't uninstall built_in packages,
        and prints helpful warning messages.</li>
    <li>Manage npm <input type="button" value="insert require"/>
        button now fixes inserted variable names
        for package with hyphens in them to have underscores instead.</li>
    <li>Removed "npm" package from DDE."npm": "^6.13.7"</li>
    <li><code>Plot.is_3d_array(data)</code> fixed to more throughly check that it really
        has a 3D array with only numbers in it. Fixes a bug in the inspector.</li>
    <li><code>Plot.show</code> fix for title defaulting.</li>
    <li>New example in: RefMan/Window System/Plot/Plot.show/heat map.</li>
    <li>RefMan/Window System/Plot/Plot.show has lots of stying and descriptive improvements.</li>
    <li>When inspecting a 2D array of numbers, it will now always show a plot button.
        If the 2D array is not one of the special kinds of 2D array used for other plots,
        a heat map plot will be shown when you click on the plot button.</li>
    <li><code>show_window</code>: Removed the default callback of "show_window_values".
        Now no callback is called when you don't specify one and you click the
        close window button.</li>
    <li>New function: <code>browse_page</code> browses a url in your default browser.
        Unlike <code>show_page</code>, this shows you the url in an editable text field.</li>

    Highlights: New facility for DDE users installing and using NPM packages
     both in the user interface, and programmatically.
     Plot code and doc enhanced.
<ul>
    <li>Fixed a Python Ref Man example to not be in test suite as its not relevant.</li>
    <li>Fix for Plot titles that contain html.</li>
    <li>New <code>Plot.show</code> examples in Ref Man/Window System/Plot/Plot.show</li>
    <li><code>Plot.show</code> first arg can now be <code>null</code> to cause it to default to "plot_id". (<code>null</code> is shorter than <code>undefined</code>.)
    <li><code>Plot.show</code> now takes a 5th arg of <code>show_window</code> options.
        These are the same as the keyword args to show_window with some different
        defaults that make more sense for plots.
        Thus a plot can have both a show_window title and a plot title.</li>
    <li><code>Plot.show</code> now handles margins better such that you can see both the
         numbers of an axis and its axis title (if it has one).</li>
    <li><code>Plot.show</code> now doesn't (by default) inspect the values that are passed to
        <code>show_window</code>'s callback. With the new 5th arg to Plot.show,
        you can explicitly pass a callback for the show_window and
         have it do something different than nothing if you like.</li>
    <li>New File menu item: "Manage npm" for listing,
         installing and uninstalling npm packages.</li>
    <li>New class <code>DDE_NPM</code> for listing, installing and uninstalling npm packages.
        See Ref Man/Adding JavaScript</li>
    <li>New start screen tutorial: <b>Adding JavaScript</b>. It
        opens up the new Ref Man section on Adding JavaScript.</li>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 3.7.5, Mar 2, 2021</summary>
Highlights: Python Interface much more useful.
            New Plot class and inspector integration.
            Simulator fixes.
<ul>
    <li>Extensions to Ref Man/Python documentation. The most substantial of which is for Windows Installation.</li>
    <li> Instruction: <code>Brain.eval_python</code> that facilitates integrating Python code into a Job.</li>
    <li>Fix for Py.init under certain circumstances for Linux.</li>
    <li>The default for the python installation in non-mac, non-windows (ie Linux, etc)
        is now "python3" instead of "python".</li>
    <li>Fixed bug in <code>Py.load_file</code> when processing slashes.</li>
    <li><code>load_files</code> can now take a .py file and it loads it using <code>Py.load_file</code>.</li>
    <li>When a Python numpy array is about to be returned to DDE,
        it is automatically converted to a list so that it can be converted to a JSON array
        and returned as a JS array.</li>
    <li>Improved callback default for <code>copy_file_async</code> to tell you the names of the files.</li>
    <li>Fixed simulator header pane numerical display for J2, J3, J4. The sign was wrong.</li>
    <li>Fixed simulator for J6 and J7.</li>
    <li>Serial Port: improved documentation on <code>serial_devices</code>.</li>
    <li>Added about 10 set_parameters to the set parameters series that shows up
        in the MakeInstruction dialog box for <code>Dexter.set_parameter</code>.</li>
    <li>Fixed Dexter set_link_lengths_using_dde_db for J6_angle_max and J7_angle_max.</li>
    <li>Compartmentalization of conversion of degrees to dexter_units (such as arcseconds) and back.</li>
    <li>Make Instruction, instructions menu now has "empty_instruction_queue" before "empty_instruction_queue_immediately"</li>
    <li>When launching DDE, now dde_init.js never comes up in the editor.
        If dde_init.js is the last file saved or it is the only file ever edited, a new buffer will come up instead.
        This prevents mistakes with this file, but you can still explicitly edit it.</li>
    <li>New class <code>Plot</code>, makes it easy to plot 1D, 2D and 3D arrays as well as move-points in Jobs.
        See Ref Man/Window System/Plot</li>

<li>Fixed bug in switching to a file on the menu of files.</li>
<li>Minor bug fix in <code>show_window</code> callback function handling for anonymous functions.</li>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 3.7.2, Jan 13, 2021</summary>
Highlights: Improved robustness of connecting DDE to Dexter including error handling
      and no longer uses ping (to aid Linux installations and speedup).
      Simplified Misc Pane header/Simulation panel header by removing the extra "Dexter" menu.
      robot_status: now 4 different possibilities: g0 (the original), g1, g2, and g_other
      for statuses that are not yet well defined, but we can still look at them in the
      robot status dialog. TestSuite enhancements.
<ul>
    <li>Fixed the Jobs menu/Dexter Tools/Browse Dexter to always browse the current Dexter.default
        and not always 192.168.1.142</li>
    <li>Now when a user quits DDE from the Electron menu quit,
        from the Electron menu item "close window" or from clicking the main DDE window's close box,
          and there is a file in the editor with unsaved changes,
          they will be prompted as to whether they want to quit DDE without saving or not.</li>
    <li>Removed Sim pane header job and robot menu. Now just use the menu in the Misc pane header for selecting
        the default Dexter.</li>
    <li>Misc pane robot menu only gets dexter instance names on it,
        sans the "Dexter." prefix. A bunch of other code simplifcations around this.</li>
    <li>Redefined <code>default_robot_name()</code>  to return "Dexter." + Dexter.default.name
        and respelled this method to: <code>default_dexter_full_name()</code></li>
    <li> Pane header: respelled text: "default robot" to "Dexter.default:"
    <li>Changed instruction: <code>Dexter.get_robot_status</code>'s only argument's default from null to 0.
         Passing in an empty argument or null, now results in changing Dexter's status mode to 0, if it wasn't already.
         Documented in Ref Man/Robot/Dexter/Dexter Instructions/get_robot_status.</li>
    <li>Misc Pane Header: now has circle i  inspect button to inspect <code>Dexter.default</code>.</li>
    <li>When starting a Job using a Dexter for the first time since lanuching DDE,
      DDE gets the link_lengths and other settings from a file on Dexter.
      Now we first try to get that file via Dexter's node server,
      and if that fails, we fall back to getting it via a Job which is slower and more error prone.</li>
    <li>The Robot Status dialog box now has a circle-i icon to the right of the selected robot.
        Clicking it inspects the selected robot.</li>
    <li>When Inspecting a Dexter, the line for "robot_status" now has a button on the end of it
        named "Robot Status Dialog" that brings up the dialog for the inspected robot.</li>
    <li>Improved the error message: "Error running instruction" to give more information about the error.</li>
    <li>Fixed bug in sending <code>Dexter.get_robot_status(1)</code> with converting from an ascii digit
        to an integer.</li>
    <li>Robot status g2 implemented. New TestSuite file for RobotStatus.</li>
    <li><code>Dexter.start</code> removed "ping" from checking for existence of Dexter.
        This simplifies the underlying code, speeds up the starting of a job,
        and doesn't depend on Ping so should work better on Linux OS.</li>
    <li>DDE's default link length and joint angle min & max now set to Dexter HDI values.</li>
    <li>Fixed bug in <code>SimUtils.is_simulator_showing()</code></li>
    <li>Fixed when_stopped_testsuite to handle new pingless architecture.</li>
    <li>Option_click on editor now improves the display of Make Instruction by
         setting the Misc pane header correctly to "Make Instruction".</li>
    <li>Improved <code>show_in_misc_pane</code> to accept arg1 of the source code for make_instruction.</li>
    <li>Improved logic in <code>show_in_misc_pane</code> to coordinate its setting from various sources.</li>
    <li>Improved instruction <code>Control.wait_until</code> by not having it send periodic
        "keep_alive" g instructions during a long wait.
         This new code is simpler, removes a bug in waiting,
         and shifts the retrying to Socket.send which already had that mechanism in place.</li>
    <li>Fixed the setting of the Misc pane menu item in two places.</li>
    <li>Using option-click to select a whole <code>new TestSuite</code> expression in the editor
        no longer switches the Misc pane to "Make Instruction"
        because usually you want to run a TestSuite with Simulate Dexter in the Misc pane.</li>
    <li>The Output Pane header STOP button now also stops running TestSuites.</li>
    <li>Fixed Simulator to compute the <i>actual</i> last frame of simulation instead of one short,
       thus improving the accuracy of simulation.</li>
    <li>The manual TestSuite has been improved with a large PHUI_GUI test.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 3.7.1, Dec 27, 2020</summary>
Highlights: Support for robot status's g1, and g_other.
<ul>
    <li>Jobs menu/Run Instruction/Show_dialog the "Change mode to" select element now is initialized to empty.
        It did not show correct mode on initialization (and can't) so better to show blank.</li>
    <li>Bug fix to <code>is_phui_button_down()</code> which was returning the opposite of the correct boolean.</li>
    <li>User Guide/User Interface/Dexter User Interface: new section describing the "point down" checkbox.</li>
    <li>Robot Status now supports g0 (the original), g1(measured angles, velocity, torque) and
        g_other (generic, any non 0 or 1 status_mode).
        Lots of improvements to the robot_status dialog box.</li>
    <li>The "I" letter to the lower right of a Job button is now a &#9432; (circle i)
          for inspecting the job. &#9432; is used other places in DDE for inspecting objects.</li>
    <li>Ref Man/Robot/Dexter/Dexter Modes/set_keep_position,
         <code>set_open_loop</code> documentation extended slightly to be clearer.</li>
    <li>Instruction <code>IO.out</code> now takes a new 4th optional arg, print_job_info.
        If true, it prints the extra info it use to: Job name, instruction ID and instruction type.
         Default is false so that old calls to this instruction now won't have this "job info".</li>
</ul>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 3.7.0, Dec 14, 2020</summary>
Highlights: Dexter User Interface: numerous fixes. Support for Robot Status "g1".

             <code>Dexter.pid_move_all_joints</code></li>
        <li>Now uses <code>insert_last_instruction_overwrite</code>
              which doesn't cause the do_list to continually
              build up but rather replaces the last instruction.</li>
        <li>Fixed: when user holds down only the shift key,
              now nothing happens, not even a warning message.</li>
        <li>Now the number keys increment the corresponding joint angle and shift-number-key decrements
            it. It use to be the reverse.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Job now has defaults:<br/>
     keep_history: false, <br/>
     show_instructions: false</li>
    <li><code>Dexter.END_EFFECTOR_IN</code> has been deprecated.
        The new, and distant past spelling is <code>Dexter.END_EFFECTOR_IO_IN</code> which is compatible
         with Dexter firmware.</li>
    <li><code>Dexter.get_robot_status</code> now takes an optional argument, status_mode,

</ul>
</details>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 3.5.8, May 9, 2020</summary>
Highlights: New Job debugging facility for stepping through JavaScript.<br/>
            Improvements to the auto-generated email when you make a suggestion/bug report.<br/>
            Signficant bugs fixed.
<ul>
    <li> Removed redundancy from Ref Man/IO/Web/get_page</li>

    <li> Now when choosing from the Insert menu, the items:
         beep, beeps, get_page, show_page, speak, speak with options,<br/>
         the doc pane will scroll to their documentation.</li>

    <li> show_page is now known by the linter and won't give you a warning.</li>

    <li> show_page now returns a window instance that you can call
         win.chose() on plus a variety of other methods.
         See: Ref Man/Window System/show_page.</li>

    <li> get_page: improved Ref Man doc, eliminated comments inserted
         when choosing Insert menu, get_page because
         they are now redundant with the Ref Man.</li>

    <li> Fixed bug that the back and forward arrows in the Doc pane didn't work
         for most of the time.</li>

    <li> The former <code>Control.debugger</code> instruction has been renamed to
         <code>Control.step_instructions</code> </li>

    <li> <code>Control.debugger</code> now means an instruction that pauses a Job
        and allows you to step through the JavaScript of a running job,
        not just each instruction. This is a low-level but powerful tool.
        See User Guide/Debugging/Stepping Instructions/step_instructions.</li>

    <li> The Misc Pane header has a new checkbox, "Js debugger". This
         allows you to start stepping the JavaScript of a running Job.</li>

    <li> Improved the organization of the User Guide for debugging,
        especially for stepping.</li>

    <li> Fixed a click help bug that caused an error when clicking in the editor.</li>

    <li> Calls to the function <code>shouldnt</code> improved by scrolling the
         doc pane to user guide Contacts.</li>

    <li> Improvements to the auto-generated email that is created when you
        click on the email address to send bug reports to in User Guide/Contact.
        Now the editor selection and a list of the running Jobs with
        their status and currently executing instruction are shown.</li>

    <li> Removed the "save file when DDE quits" functionality
        because it looks like that was causing an empty file to be saved
        for the current file, thus losing the whole contents of the file.
        Now you may lose the contents of the buffer since you last saved it
        if there is an unexpected quit of DDE.
        Note that if you have the File menu item "Auto Save" checked,
        saves will happen upon clicking the eval button and switching
        editor buffers, so with this checked, if you eval via the
        Eval button some horrible crashing code, your latest editor buffer
        will still be saved (with the crashing code!)</li>

    <li> robustified utils is_string_a_integer to return false if passed a non-string.</li>

    <li> fixed bug in Job.report() of undefined fn now in SW class.</li>

    <li> serial_port_init() is no longer called during startup, to
        avoid the message:
        "Warning: Calling serial_port_init() is no longer necessary to use the serial port
        capability. It now does nothing."</li>

    <li> tweaked Job.insert_instruction so that instructions inserted at location "end"
        always are top level instructions on the do_list.
        This improves inspecting the do_list hierarchy.</li>

    <li> RefMan/Robot/Robot Instructions/Control/start_job  improved.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 3.5.7, Apr 21, 2020</summary>

        Jobs menu/Insert Example/Generators from
        function* foo(){...} to
        var foo function* (){...}

    <li> Jobs menu/Insert Example/Human Instr/ Job Example 7g: Dexter User Interface
          replace min & max of ranges on the

    <li> inspect improvements:
      <ul>
          <li>when calling inspect(foo) the source of the arg is shown.</li>
          <li>primitives (numbers, etc.) are shown in a proper inspect formatting
              including their type, instead of just printing the primitive.</li>

              an array element.</li>
          <li>Proper grammar in Inspect title w.r.t. "a" and "an", esp. with noun "array".</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

             <li> Function: <code>serial_devices</code> can only work on the dde platform, not on the Job Engine.
                  New method <code>serial_devices_async</code> works on both dde and Job Engine.
                  See Ref Man/Robot Serial/Low Level Serial/serial_devices/async</li>
             <li>Other serial port functions now available in the job engine.</li>
         </ul>
    </li>

    <li> Improved documentation of User Guide/User Interface/Help System/Eval button</li>

    <li> Fixed bug in "Save on eval" that was not saving the editor buffer every time
         the eval button was clicked.</li>

    <li> Improved doc and tooltip help for keystrokes that run test suites.</li>

    <li>The Recording INSERT dialog  box: improved radio button label from
        "Job containing reference" to  "new Job def containing reference"
        to make it clearer what that radio button inserts.</li>

    <li> In Make Instruction pane, Instructions menu, improved tooltips for
         Misc/function, function*, new Dexter, new Serial.</li>

    <li> Job.prototype.to_source_code now prints out the robot property
         if the robot is NOT Dexter.dexter0</li>

    <li>Error Handling
       <ul>
           <li> Control.error The reason for the Job ending made less redundant.</li>
           <li> Improved error messages:
               When a job's instruction errors, an error message with
               the source code of that instruction is printed in the output pane.</li>
           <li><b>if_error</b> Job Param replaced with Params:
               <code>if_robot_status_error</code>,
               </code>if_instruction_error</code>/>

               that defaults to <code>true</code>.
            </li>
           <li>New Job status_code:  <code>"running_when_stopped"</code> which is
              used when the Job is performing the when_stopped instruction while

<details class="doc_details"><summary>v 3.5.3, Feb 18, 2020</summary>
Highlights: User Interface 2 extended.
            Simulator extended.
            New Kin functions for Dexter control.
            Experimental code for camera control.
<ul>
    <li> When defining a new Job, if your job name is invalid, such as starting with a digit,
        it errors, telling you why and what to do about it.</li>

    <li> When defining a new Robot, if your Robot name is invalid, such as starting with a digit,
          it errors, telling you why and what to do about it.</li>

    <li> <code>selector_set_in_ui</code>, when used to set the <code>checked</code> property of
        an INPUT checkbox element,
        the second arg to <code>selector_set_in_ui</code> can be:
        <code>false</code>, <code>"false"</code>, <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>
        (not passed) to indicate unchecked. All other values indicate checked.
        See Ref Man/Window System/Window Utilities/selector_set_in_ui</li>
    <li>Dexter UserInterface 2 improvements
        <ul>
            <li> Fixed bug in Dexter UserInterface 2 that caused a low-level warning
                 upon initialization.</li>

            <li> Dexter User Interface 2 now uses pid_move_all_joints to get smoother movement.</li>

            <li> Dexter User Interface 2 window title bar now tells you the name of the
                 Dexter its controlling.</li>

            <li> Dexter User Interface 2 window title bar now tells you the name of the
                 Dexter its controlling.</li>

            <li> Dexter User Interface 2 now has a "Point Down" checkbox so that
                regardless of other controls, Dexter tries to point the end effector down
                towards the table.</li>

            <li> Dexter User Interface 2, when point_down is checked, the sliders for sliders for j4 and j5
                are disabled since user shouldn't be able to adjust those,
                but they will be adjusted automatically.</li>

            <li> Dexter User Interface 2, xy slider now has pink background
                 with a white donut. The white area is valid territory for the
                 green dot (end effector).
                 That donut size will be affected by the Z position of the end effector.</li>

            <li> Dexter User Interface 2, Z slider now has its height adjusted according
                to the maximum Z that can be acheived with the given x, y position.
                This maximum Z will be dynamically adjusted as you drag x & y green dot.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li> Kin (kinematics) improvements:
       <ul>
            <li> Kin.xy_donut_slice_approx(a_z, a_dir) Now never returns a NaN.
                If the outer_r was going to be a NaN, now it returns 0, and
                in such cases the inner_r is made 0 as well.</li>

            <li> New fn: <code>Kin.reach_extents()</code></li>

            <li> New fn: <code>Kin.max_z()</code></li>

            <li> New fn: <code>Kin.J_angles_to_dir(angles)</code> => direction of link 5.</li>

            <li> Simplified <code>Kin.point_down</code> implementation.</li>

            <li> None of these new Kin fns now take L (for Links). At a later date,
                they will take a Dexter instance and get link lengths from that.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li> Improved display of info in Output Pane from Picture.show_video_cameras.</li>

    <li> Fixed console.log error about "Cannot find module './robot.js'
         Despite this error message, DDE robots still worked,
         but there was some inconsequential code causing this error message
         that has been fixed.</li>

    <li> DDE menu Insert/Color added suffix "..." to indicate that it causes a dialog to pop up.</li>

    <li> Simulator improvements:
        <ul>
            <li>  got rid of the "tool rack".</li>
            <li>  added bright green labels for x, y and z dimensions.</li>
            <li>  added a maroon circuit board to one side of link 2 so that you
                   can tell Dexter's orientation.</li>
            <li> repositioned the virtual camera on the simulation so that when
                 the simulator comes up,
                 you see +x pointing to the right, and +y pointing towards you.</li>
         </ul>
    </li>

    <li> Added  multicast-dns package to DDE
        now var mdns = require('multicast-dns')()
        is available as documented in https://www.npmjs.com/package/multicast-dns</li>

    <li> Fix documentation so that the version of the User Guide that is on hdrobotic.com
         has the correct version number and release date under About.</li>

            New Dexter User Interface dialog for operating Dexter via sliders.
            Increased flexibility for show_video and take_picture.
            Lots of Window System tweaks.
<ul>
    <li><code>show_window combo_box</code> now has a wider "down arrow".</li>

    <li> For the Human instructions, if a dependent job doesn't exist and we're trying to stop
        all the dependent jobs because the user is stopping the job of the human instruction,
        don't error, just do nothing
        as the dependent job already isn't running.</li>

    <li> Control.wait_until(a_num) and Control.loop had a bug in that
        if the job its in was stopped in the middle of one of these instructions,
        then the NEXT time you ran the job, it would not be properly initialized.
        Fixed.</li>

    <li> For Human instructions, new init param: <code>add_stop_button=true</code>
        (not for speak, recognize_speech, but for:
        <ul>
            <li> task</li>
            <li> enter_choice</li>
            <li> enter_instruction</li>
            <li> notify </li>
         </ul>
         Other Human instructions where this button makes sense already have this option.
    </li>

    <li> Much more complete documentation under Ref Man/Robot/Human on the
        parameters that are in common with most Human Instructions.</li>

    <li> svg functions extended to be able to take NO args and not error.</li>

    <li> Dragging svg elements in a show_window can now be enabled.
        See Ref Man/Window System/SVG/html_class.</li>

    <li> Fixed bug in Job.insert_instruction that caused an error message,
        but often wouldn't affect job performance.</li>

    <li> Drastically reduced calls to <code>color_job_button</code>
         when a job is waiting for more instructions.
        This reduces computation for waiting jobs esp.
        more important for job engine browser interface.</li>

    <li> Bug fixed in simulator pane header that was causing x,y,z values not to update properly.</li>

    <li> Simulator pane header Joint degrees formatting improved.</li>

    <li> New hidden input to a <code>show_window</code> content of "show_window_elt_id"
         with the string value of the id,
          so that the handler fn can easily find the show-window in order to modify it.</li>

    <li> Sim pane header x,y,z display now shows millimeters, not just centimeters,
         for negative number.</li>

    <li> added to each Dexter instance, the properties:
         J6_angle_min, J6_angle_max, J7_angle_min, J7_angle_max.</li>

    <li> now SW.all_show_windows returns a proper array instead of a nodelist.</li>

    <li> Fixed <code>SW.close_all_show_windows()</code> to not depend on its subject to work.</li>


    <li> New Jobs menu/Dexter Tools/Dexter UI... item that brings up a show_window to
        operate Dexter. Jas slider and number controls for J1 -> J7 and X,Y,Z.</li>

    <li> SW.close_window, fixed internal bug.</li>

    <li> <code>Picture.save_picture</code> and <code>IO.save_picture</code>
        no longer display the picture that it is saving.
        If you want that, you'll have to explicitly show_picture it.</li>


    <li> Fixed bug in <code>Picture.show_video</code> for its "playing" state.</li>


    <li> Add a visible=true init param to <code>show_video</code>.</li>

    <li><code>take_picture</code> doesn't automatically <code>show_video now</code>.</li>

    <li> Fixed  dragging a <code>show window</code> in Job Engine browser interface.</li>

    <li> New function: <code>selector_set_in_ui</code>.
         Uses CSS selector syntax to identify HTML elements which
        can be removed, replaced, modified, or extended.
        See Ref Man/ Window System/Window Utilities/selector_set_in_ui.</li>

    <li> New Insert menu item: show_window/Modify Window
        Inserts an example of using the new <code>selector_set_in_ui</code>
        to change a button color
        and insert HTML into a show_window.</li>

    <li> New Example under Jobs menu/Insert Example/Human Instrs
         for "Dexter User Interface" (the simple version with just 7 sliders, one for each joint).
        This is far simpler than the Insert menu item: show_window/Modify Window,
        and so much easier to understand as a code tutorial.</li>

    <li> During the "progress" report on a job, if a function is encountered,
        it prints out the NAME of the function, not its entire def.
        This gets rid of what is usually unnecessary detail for certain
        debugging situations.</li>

    <li> The <code>RobotStatus</code> class is now part of the Job engine.</li>

    <li> <code>Control.loop</code> documentation extended with a description to the loop example
         and an additional loop example added.</li>

    <li> <code>SW.close_window</code> extended to take a dom elt as its arg.
         If that dom_elt is within a <code>show_window</code>, that show_wikndow is closed.</li>

    <li> <code>Kin.point_down</code> and <code>Kin.xy_donut_slice_approx</code> added.
        These are still experimental and so not yet documented.</li>

    <li> <code>write_file</code>  Improved error message when the file to write is in a non-exisitent folder.</li>

    <li> <code>make_folder</code> fixed for passing in an arg of the empty string and
          some other cases.</li>
</ul>
