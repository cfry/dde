<b>Prerequisites:</b> A bit of JavaScript programming
(which you can get with a few hours of playing with Dexter Development Environment)
and a thirst for understanding how software works.
<p></p>
The bulk of this article is about understanding the core function of
thinking like a computer. In JavaScript and Lisp,
this function is named <code>eval</code>. But ...

<h4>Why Think Like a Computer?</h4>
<ul><li>It will help you debug code faster.</li>
    <li>It will help you design algorithms better.</li>
    <li>It can be used for "end user scripting" where you want
        the give the user a wider range of options than can fit on menus.</li>
    <li>It can help you understand structured reasoning, useful for
        complex non-programming tasks like decision-making.</li>
</ul>
<b>Disclaimer:</b> The title will conjure up, in the minds of many readers,
that this article is about zeros and ones, about logic gates executing
and/or/not. All that is good to know, but it is too low level
to understand most of the interesting things about software.
<p></p>
There are many ways to understand Eval. Here's some important ones:<br/>
<b>Definition 1:</b> <i>For the JS programmer</i><br/>
<code>eval</code> is a JavaScript function.
Its first argument is a string of source code.
It "runs" the source code and returns a value (if any).
Side effects of running the code are performed.
<p></p>
<b>Definition 2:</b> <i>For the C programmer</i><br/>
eval parses & compiles source code, executes it, and returns a value,
all in one fell swoop.
In 2017, JavaScript runs about half the speed of compiled C.
Given Moore's law you could say JS today runs about as fast as C did
18 months ago. Or you could say 
"JS is faster to write working code than C, so I care about programmer time more than
execution time." Of course, running faster saves programmer time,
but for most user interface operations, the difference between
1 millisecond and 10 milliseconds is unnoticeable.
<p></p>
<b>Definition 3:</b> <i>Data-centric</i><br/>
eval converts data from one format (a string of source code)
into another format (a Boolean, number, array, object, or possibly
a different, or even the same, string)
Both the input and output are representations
of the same data.<br/>
<i>Example:</i> <code title="unEVALable">"2 + 3"</code> means the same thing as <samp>5</samp>,
more or less.
<p></p>
<b>Definition 4:</b> <i>Conceptual</i><br/>
Eval is a process for manipulating information.
You can think of it as a "translator" from its
input language to its output language.
This process of translation is actually a meta process. 
The input to
eval is source code that describes a process,
and eval 'runs" that process using the "eval process".
<p></p>
<b>Definition 5:</b> <i>Linguistic</i><br/>
If we expand our concept of eval to other languages,
say English or "picture", eval takes low level "syntax"
(audio or text)
and converts it into higher level "semantics".
Or perhaps you'd prefer: converting "information" into
"knowledge". A language is a mapping between syntax
and semantics. Eval is a process for converting
syntax into semantics. Different languages will
have different syntaxes, at least somewhat different
semantics, and, necessarily, different evals.
Regardless, the concept of Eval is the very essence of language.
<p></p>
<b>Definition 6:</b> <i>Philosophic</i><br/>
Eval is a basic process of "thinking".
A dyed-in-the-wool Lisp programmer would say that
if you don't understand eval, you don't understand.
What I'd say is that the *easiest* way to understand is
to understand Eval. You certainly won't be a decent
JavaScript programmer without understanding eval.
The good news is that eval isn't SO hard to understand.
The bad news is you can't understand eval without understanding
eval. We solve this chicken and egg problem below.

<h3>Examples</h3>
JavaScript's eval, like all other JS function calls,
has its arguments evaluated, then those values are passed into the function body.
For arguments of most types, eval just returns the argument.<br/>
<code>eval(true)</code> => <samp>true</samp> (returns the input <code>true</code>)<br/>
<code>eval(2 + 3)</code> => <samp>5</samp> (returns the input <code>5</code>)
<p></p>
But if the argument is a string, it is treated as source code and executed.<br/>
<code>eval("true")</code> => <samp>true</samp> (the Boolean symbol)<br/>
<code>eval("123")</code>  => <samp>123</samp>  (an integer)<br/>
<code>eval("'123'")</code> => <samp>"123"</samp> (a string of 3 characters, all of which happen to be digits.)<br/>
<code>eval("12" + "3")</code> => <samp>123</samp> (an integer)<br/>
<code>eval("12 + 3")</code>   => <samp>15</samp> (an integer)<br/>
<code>eval("'12' + '3'")</code> => <samp>"123"</samp> (a string)<br/>
<code>eval("Math.min(2, 3)")</code> => <samp>2</samp> (an integer)<br/>
<br/>
In all of the above examples, there's really 2 evals occurring. The first
is as part of the function calling mechanism of JS. The argument is
evaled. Then THAT value is passed into eval and our 2nd eval occurs.
<p></p>
Below we have 3 evals. The first, <code>"'123'"</code>
evaluates to a string with 5 characters in it. (3 digits and two surrounding single quote characters.)
Then that string is passed into the inner eval which returns a new string
of 3 digits. Finally, that string of 3 digits is passed to the outer eval
and it returns a number.
<p></p>
<code>eval(eval("'123'"))</code> => <samp>123</samp> (an integer)<br/>
These examples are nit-picky, tedious, and essential to getting
what eval does. Spend the time to understand them and you will save
hours of debugging.
<p></p>
Since we can manipulate strings of code,
we can create source code with our program,
then eval that source code. 
Thus in a language with eval, the code
that is executed is not limited to the code in the program.<br/>
This is considered dangerous by security professionals.<br/>
This is considered powerful by people who understand what
a good language can do.
<p></p>
Both perspectives are accurate, but imagine if you were told
<i>Here's two interesting ideas for you but you're not
allowed to combine them at a low level and come up with something really creative.</i>
That's the equivalent of programming in a language without eval.
Even if you don't call eval directly, it is often an underlying
tool for sophisticated tools that you <i>do</i> use.
DDE couldn't have been written without eval.

<h3>Implementation</h3>
You won't understand eval until you understand how to implement eval.
So now we show you what's in this magic box by gradually 
implementing a simple eval.
We name it "eval zero", or eval0 for short.
We are going to implement this using a combination of regular JS and itself.
We will cut corners to use a minimum amount of JS, keeping our new eval0 simple.
<p></p>
Our first pass handles most input data types accurately.<br/>
<pre><code>function eval0(arg){
    <samp class="new_code">return arg</samp>
}</code></pre>

<i>Example:</i> <code>eval0(2 + 3)</code> => <samp>5</samp>
<p></p>
Next we handle two easy case string inputs without losing our
'return non-strings" functionality.
<pre><code>function eval0(arg) {
    <samp class="new_code">let the_type = typeof(arg)
    if(the_type === "string"){
        if      (arg === "true")  {return true}
        else if (arg === "false") {return false}
    }</samp>
    return arg
}</code></pre>
<i>Example:</i> <code>eval0("true")</code> => <samp>true</samp>
<p></p>
Next we handle strings containing numbers:

<pre><code>function eval0(arg) {
    let the_type = typeof(arg)
    if(the_type === "string"){
        if (arg === "true")  {return true}
        if (arg === "false") {return false}
        <samp class="new_code">return parseFloat(arg)</samp>
    }
    return arg
}</code></pre>

<i>Example:</i> <code>eval0("123")</code> => <samp>123</samp>
<p></p>
Now let's implement <code>+</code> . This is a bit harder because
we can't just assume <i>If its not true or false, it must be a number</i>
like we did above. Our extra work for <code>+</code> will come in
handy for numerous other features as well.

<pre><code>function eval0(arg) {
    let the_type = typeof(arg)
    if(the_type === "string"){
        if (arg === "true")  {return true}
        if (arg === "false") {return false}
        <samp class="new_code">let an_array = arg.split(" ")
        if (an_array.length === 1){</samp>
            return parseFloat(arg)
        <samp class="new_code">}
        if(an_array.length === 3){
            if(an_array[1] === "+") { return eval0(an_array[0]) + eval0(an_array[2]) }
        }</samp>
    }
    return arg
}</code></pre>

<i>Example:</i> <code>eval0("2 + 3")</code> => <samp>5</samp>
<p></p>
Above we use <code>split</code> to divide up <code title="unEVALable">arg</code> into the 3 smaller strings
that are separated by spaces in <code title="unEVALable">arg</code>. <code>split</code> returns an array
(a sequence of items) accessible by their positions within the array.
We're also (recursively) calling eval0 to process the two strings of digits
on either side of "+" into numbers before adding them together
with +. 
<p></p>
Its fair to complain we're not implementing all the features of JS + here.
True. We don't handle string arguments or <code>1 + 2 + 3</code> .
Like mentioned above, we're cutting corners to simplify understanding.
<p></p>
A more serious critique is that we're not implementing <code>+</code> at all,
we're passing off the real work to JS's +. Sure, but if we like,
we could replace that call to <code>+</code> with <code>*</code> i.e.<br/>
<code>eval0(an_array[0]) * eval0(an_array[2])</code><br/>
or even:<br/>
<code title="unEVALable">eval0(new_plus(an_array[0]), eval0(an_array[2]))</code><br/>
eval doesn't do all the work itself, it farms it out to utility functions
like <code>+</code>. Think of eval as a manager, not a worker-bee.
Or think of <code>+</code> as a modular extension of eval used to
decrease the complexity of implementing the core "traffic directing" of eval.
<p></p>
<code>if</code> is JS's low-level traffic director. We nest ifs
to get hierarchical traffic directing. You can even think of eval as
just packaging up a bunch of ifs.
<p></p>
So far we've just used eval to <i>return</i> values. But we can also use it
for side-effects like setting a variable value.
<pre><code>function eval0(arg) {
    let the_type = typeof(arg)
    if(the_type === "string"){
        if (arg === "true") {return true}
        if (arg === "false"){return false}
        let an_array = arg.split(" ")
        if (an_array.length === 1){
            return parseFloat(arg)
        }
        if(an_array.length === 3){
            if(an_array[1] === "+") { return eval0(an_array[0])  + eval0(an_array[2]) }
            <samp class="new_code">if(an_array[1] === "=") { return window[an_array[0]] = eval0(an_array[2]) }</samp>
        }
    }
    return arg
}</code></pre>

<i>Example:</i> <code>eval0("foo = 2")</code> => <samp>2</samp><br/>
sets the global variable named "foo" to the number 2.
<p></p>
We can get back the value by handling variable references with:
<pre><code>function eval0(arg) {
    let the_type = typeof(arg)
    if(the_type === "string"){
        if (arg === "true") {return true}
        if (arg === "false"){return false}
        let an_array = arg.split(" ")
        if (an_array.length === 1){
            <samp class="new_code">if(window[arg] === undefined){</samp>
                return parseFloat(arg)
            <samp class="new_code">}
            return window[arg]</samp>
        }
        if(an_array.length === 3){
             if(an_array[1] === "+") { return eval0(an_array[0]) + eval0(an_array[2]) }
             if(an_array[1] === "=") { return window[an_array[0]] = eval0(an_array[2]) }
        }
    }
    return arg
}</code></pre>

<i>Example:</i> <code>eval0("foo")</code> => <samp>2</samp>
<p></p>
Above, if <code title="unEVALable">arg</code> doesn't have spaces and is in <code>window</code>,
we assume its a global variable and return its value.
<p></p>
We're using <code title="unEVALable">===</code> a bunch for comparison, so let's implement it.
<pre><code>eval0(arg) {
    let the_type = typeof(arg)
    if(the_type === "string"){
        if (arg === "true") {return true}
        if (arg === "false"){return false}
        let an_array = arg.split(" ")
        if (an_array.length === 1){
            if(window[arg] === undefined){
                return parseFloat(arg)
            }
            return window[arg]
        }
        if(an_array.length === 3){
             if(an_array[1] === "+")  { return eval0(an_array[0]) + eval0(an_array[2]) }
             if(an_array[1] === "=")  { return window[an_array[0]] = eval0(an_array[2]) }
             <samp class="new_code">if(an_array[1] === "==="){ return eval0(an_array[0]) === eval0(an_array[2])}</samp>
        }
   }
   return arg
}</code></pre>

<i>Example:</i> <code>eval0("2 === 2")</code> => <samp>true</samp><br/>
<i>Example:</i> <code>eval0("2 === 3")</code> => <samp>false</samp>
<p></p>
Here's a poor man's implementation of return
<pre><code>function eval0(arg) {
    let the_type = typeof(arg)
    if(the_type === "string"){
        if(arg === "true") {return true}
        if(arg === "false"){return false}
        <samp class="new_code">if(arg.startsWith("return")){return eval0(arg.substring(7))}</samp>
        let an_array = arg.split(" ")
        if (an_array.length === 1){
            if(window[arg] === undefined){
                return parseFloat(arg)
            }
            return window[arg]
        }
        if(an_array.length === 3){
             if(an_array[1] === "+")  {return eval0(an_array[0]) + eval0(an_array[2])}
             if(an_array[1] === "=")  {return window[an_array[0]] = eval0(an_array[2])}
             if(an_array[1] === "==="){return eval0(an_array[0]) === eval0(an_array[2])}
        }
    }
    return arg
}</code></pre>
<i>Example:</i> <code>eval0("return 4")</code> => <samp>4</samp><br/>
<i>Example:</i> <code>eval0("return 2 + 3")</code> => <samp>5</samp><br/>

Note the above doesn't work in JS eval. 
But for our cheap eval0, it will come in handy soon.
<p></p>
Now let's tackle the principle control-flow functionality of <code>if</code>.
<pre><code>function eval0(arg) {
    let the_type = typeof(arg)
    if(the_type === "string"){
        if(arg === "true") {return true}
        if(arg === "false"){return false}
        if(arg.startsWith("return")){return eval0(arg.substring(7))}
        <samp class="new_code">if (arg.startsWith("if(")){
            let close_pos = arg.indexOf(")")
            let condition = arg.substring(3, close_pos)
            let action = arg.substring(close_pos + 2, arg.length - 1)
            if(eval0(condition)){return eval0(action)}
            return undefined
        }</samp>
        let an_array = arg.split(" ")
        if(an_array.length === 1){
            if(window[arg] === undefined){
                return parseFloat(arg)
            }
            return window[arg]
        }
        if(an_array.length === 3){
             if(an_array[1] === "+")  {return eval0(an_array[0]) + eval0(an_array[2])}
             if(an_array[1] === "=")  {return window[an_array[0]] = eval0(an_array[2])}
             if(an_array[1] === "==="){return eval0(an_array[0]) === eval0(an_array[2])}
        }
    }
    return arg
}</code></pre>

<i>Example:</i> <code>eval0("if(3 === 3){return 33}")</code> => <samp>33</samp><br/>
<i>Example:</i> <code>eval0("if(3 === 4){return 33}")</code> => <samp>undefined</samp><br/>
<i>Example:</i> <code>eval0("if(3 === 3){return 4 + 5}")</code> => <samp>9</samp>
<p></p>
We facilitate complexity by dividing up code into reusable functions.
Here's a cheap implementation of defining zero-argument functions:
<pre><code>function eval0(arg) {
    let the_type = typeof(arg)
    if(the_type === "string"){
        if(arg === "true") {return true}
        if(arg === "false"){return false}
        if(arg.startsWith("return")){return eval0(arg.substring(7))}
        if (arg.startsWith("if(")){
            let close_pos = arg.indexOf(")")
            let condition = arg.substring(3, close_pos)
            let action = arg.substring(close_pos + 2, arg.length - 1)
            if(eval0(condition)){return eval0(action)}
            return undefined
        }
        <samp class="new_code">if(arg.startsWith("function ")){
           let open_pos = arg.indexOf("(")
           let name = arg.substring(9, open_pos)
           let open_brace = arg.indexOf("{")
           let body = arg.substring(open_brace + 1, arg.length - 1)
           window[name] = body
           return undefined
        }</samp>
        let an_array = arg.split(" ")
        if(an_array.length === 1){
            if(window[arg] === undefined){
                return parseFloat(arg)
            }
            return window[arg]
        }
        if(an_array.length === 3){
             if(an_array[1] === "+")  {return eval0(an_array[0]) + eval0(an_array[2])}
             if(an_array[1] === "=")  {return window[an_array[0]] = eval0(an_array[2])}
             if(an_array[1] === "==="){return eval0(an_array[0]) === eval0(an_array[2])}
        }
    }
    return arg
}</code></pre>

<i>Example:</i> <code>eval0("function bar(){return 6 + 7}")</code><br/>
<i>Example:</i> <code>eval0("bar")</code> => <samp>"return 6 + 7"</samp><br/>
Above the definition of our function is just the string of its body. Cheap, incomplete,
but adequate for a first pass.
<p></p>
After we've defined our function, we need a way to call it.
We tackle such zero-argument function calls with the below:

<pre><code>function eval0(arg) {
    let the_type = typeof(arg)
    if(the_type === "string"){
        if(arg === "true") {return true}
        if(arg === "false"){return false}
        if(arg.startsWith("return")){return eval0(arg.substring(7))}
        if (arg.startsWith("if(")){
            let close_pos = arg.indexOf(")")
            let condition = arg.substring(3, close_pos)
            let action = arg.substring(close_pos + 2, arg.length - 1)
            if(eval0(condition)){return eval0(action)}
            return undefined
        }
        if(arg.startsWith("function ")){
           let open_pos = arg.indexOf("(")
           let name = arg.substring(9, open_pos)
           let open_brace = arg.indexOf("{")
           let body = arg.substring(open_brace + 1, arg.length - 1)
           window[name] = body
           return undefined
        }
        <samp class="new_code">if(arg.endsWith(")")){
          let name = arg.split("(")[0]
          return eval0(eval0(name))
        }</samp>
        let an_array = arg.split(" ")
        if(an_array.length === 1){
            if(window[arg] === undefined){
                return parseFloat(arg)
            }
            return window[arg]
        }
        if(an_array.length === 3){
             if(an_array[1] === "+")  {return eval0(an_array[0]) + eval0(an_array[2])}
             if(an_array[1] === "=")  {return window[an_array[0]] = eval0(an_array[2])}
             if(an_array[1] === "==="){return eval0(an_array[0]) === eval0(an_array[2])}
        }
    }
    return arg
}</code></pre>

<i>Example:</i> <code>eval0("bar()")</code> => <samp>13</samp><br/>
In the crucial line above,<br/>
<code title="unEVALable">eval0(eval0(name))</code><br/>
in the inner call to eval0, we are evaling <code title="unEVALable">name</code> to get the
body source code of the function bar, which is<br/>
<code>"return 6 + 7}"</code><br/>
That string is passed to our outer eval0, which ultimately evals the string<br/>
<code title="unEVALable">"6 + 7"</code><br/>
who's result is <code>13</code>, which is finally returned.
<p></p>
Recursive calls to <code>eval0</code> make this admittedly tricky to wrap
your head around, but by breaking down each piece to the small action that it performs,
the synergistic whole of <code>eval0</code> adds up to more than the
sum of its parts. This is the magic of eval.


<p></p>
Before wrapping up our definition of eval0, let's throw in a few more features
because its easy, they are commonly needed in JS, and to paint the way
for further extension, should you care to implement it.
Here's handling <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code> and string literals.

<pre><code>function eval0(arg) {
    let the_type = typeof(arg)
    if(the_type === "string"){
        if(arg === "true"){return true}
        if(arg === "false"){return false}
        <samp class="new_code">if(arg === "null"){return null}
        if(arg === "undefined"){return undefined}

<h3>Results</h3>
What haven't we accomplished? We haven't made a practical eval
because its missing many features of JavaScript, many of which are
essential for writing useful applications. In particular,
there's no support for
local variables, arrays, objects, looping and error handling.
Our support for return, strings, if, arithmetic, comparisons,
handling of whitespace and many other features is incomplete.
<p></p>
The most important omission is functions that take arguments.
Functions are the "verbs" of programming. Their arguments are the adverbs,
helping to customize a function to be applicable to myriads of additional
uses.
<p></p>
<i>Hint:</i> Local variables are implemented with name-value pair data structures
just like the <code>window</code> data structure we use above for global variables.
At function call time, such a data structure is populated with the names
of the arguments and their values, then passed into eval so that references
to local variables can be looked up in it. A helper function for eval that is defined in
JS named <code>apply</code> takes a function as a subject, a value for
<code title="unEVALable">this</code> and an array of argument values.
<p></p>
Despite all these deficiencies, let's celebrate our victories.
The goal was not to duplicate the eval of JavaScript, highly
evolved over decades. It was to understand the core concepts
of what eval embodies and how it can be achieved. The number
one task of a programmer is to be able to understand code.
You do that best by running eval in your head. You do <i>that</i>
best by knowing how eval is implemented. 
<p></p>
Eval is the most complex function in JS, so we can't expect
it to be easy to completely understand. But even a low resolution
understanding will make you a better programmer.
Understanding this article will likely take at least a couple of readings
and much pondering.  By then, you'll be ahead of
the majority of programmers, even those with a decade of experience
under their belt, in one crucial aspect of programming.
<p></p>
If you examine the features we have implemented and the features used
by eval0, we've got a pretty healthy start on implementing what's
needed by eval, all in about 40 lines of code. With
several times more code, we could define eval0 by just the features
it supports. Thus evaling:<br/>
<code title="unEVALable">eval0("function eval0(arg){...}")</code>
would redefine not just eval0, but the
language that it itself is written in.
This achieves the "meta"
goal so essential (magical though it may be) to advanced knowledge processing.

<h3>Eval In DDE</h3>
The editor buffer edits a string, the input to Eval.
DDE's Eval button takes that string and passes it
to JavaScript's eval function (with a bit of extra processing)
and formats the result of calling eval into the Output pane.

<h4>Files</h4>
A file is just a big string of source code.
"Loading" the file passes the string to eval.
DDE has a function named <code>load_files</code> that performs this.
It can load large files provided the JS source code is valid.
<p></p>
In JavaScript there's no explicit compiler or compiled representation
of source code, though internally all kinds of clever tricks
are played by eval to make code run fast.

<h4>Jobs</h4>
You can eval regular old JS this way, but DDE has a bunch of "libraries"
or extensions to JS (all written in JS) that help you do higher level things.
The most important one is defining a Job to make things.
<code title="unEVALable">new Job({name: "my_job", do_list:[...]})</code>
uses JS syntax and a definition of the class <code>Job</code> to make
a new instance of Job, which is a data structure
with name-value parts.
<p></p>
One of the ways that data structure is represented is as a button
in the Output pane header named by the Job's name.
Clicking that button automatically constructs the string
<code>"Job.my_job.start()"</code> and then passes that string to eval.
<code>start</code> starts DDE's special "do_list eval" that picks the
instructions, one by one, off the do_list and
"evals" them with the special evaluator.
Here's some of the most important rules of DDE's do_list evaluator:
<ul>
<li>If the instruction
is a <code>Dexter.move_all_joints</code> instruction, the 5 joint degrees are
translated into arc-seconds (which the precise Dexter likes)
and sent to Dexter. </li>

<li>If the instruction is a <code>Dexter.move_to</code>,
the X, Y, and Z numbered arguments are "translated" into
5 joint angles (via DDE's "Kinematics evaluator") and
those joint angles are sent to Dexter.</li>

<li>If the instruction is a JS function definition,
that function is called. Calling a function fundamentally
calls eval on the code in the body of the function definition.</li>
</ul>
You can even think of a <code>Job</code> instance as a function who's
body is the Job's do_list. Arguments can be effectively passed to
a Job by initializing its <code title="unEVALable">user_data</code> variables.
During the running of a Job, it can get additional inputs by referencing other
Jobs' user_data, as well as by asking the user through DDE's "Human" instructions.

<h3>Eval in Making</h3>
When 3D printing, there's a description of the object you want to
print in some "CAD" file. One of the formats of such files is
as JavaScript, which describes the shapes to print.
Typically that file is "translated" into STL format, a low
level representation of triangles. Then STL is cut up (translated) into
<i>layers</i> by  a "slicer", a special kind of evaluator. Each
layer is then turned into a "tool path" for the motion
of the 3D printer's extruder, and when the extruder is
to be extruding molten plastic. Finally this tool path
(usually in the language "g-code") is sent to the 
printer itself. The printer can be though of as a kind of
"eval" that translates g_code into a physical object.

<h3>Language Design</h3>
The straightforward way to implement an app is to implement
the features of a specification. The problem with this
approach is that when the spec <i>inevitably</i> changes,
you may have to re-architect your application to make some
relatively minor semantic change.
<p></p>
Such disruption <i>can</i> be avoided by first
implementing a language that describes the domain
of your application. After that, call your new language to
implement the surface features of your application.
When the spec changes, your underlying language doesn't have to,
providing a good base for improving your app.
<p></p>
Designing a good foundational language is a special skill
not taught in even the best universities in 2017.
Understanding eval is on the easiest path to knowing how to design languages.
<p></p>
If your underlying language is good enough (like JS)
leverage it so you don't have to
re-implement the low_level stuff.
Think of a well written function definition or Job in a library
as a reusable extension to eval.

<h3>Summary</h3>
This article stretches a metaphor to give you
eval-colored glasses to visualize software (and even hardware!)
This perspective will aid in debugging and architecting code.
It is not a popular perspective nor the only useful one.
But I do hope it will demystify complexity
and help you literally <i>make</i> the world a better place.
