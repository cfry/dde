<div style="color:red;">The HCA UI is a work in progress, not yet ready for practical use.</div>
HCA stands for Heterogeneous Computing Architecture. HCA_UI is a user interface
    to writing software for Dexter's FPGA, using a graphical editor.
    The tool creates a JSON representation of the layout of the objects in the editor.
    That JSON representation is sent to a compiler that makes a compiled gateware file which
    is stored on Dexter and controls the computation of the FPGA.
    That gateware can move Dexter's joints, captures joint positions
    from the optical sensor on each joint and perform additional
    very fast. parallel computations.

    <details class="doc_details"><summary>DDE User Interface for HCA</summary>
        The HCA UI reuses components of the DDE user interface
        for those opperations that are in common with
        normal DDE editing.
