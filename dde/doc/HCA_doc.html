<div style="color:red;">The HCA UI is a work in progress, not yet ready for practical use.</div>
HCA stands for Heterogeneous Computing Architecture. HCA_UI is a user interface
    to writing software for Dexter's FPGA, using a graphical editor.
    The tool creates a JSON representation of the layout of the objects in the editor.
    That JSON representation is sent to a compiler that makes a compiled gateware file which
    is stored on Dexter and controls the computation of the FPGA.
    That gateware can move Dexter's joints, captures joint positions
    from the optical sensor on each joint and perform additional
    very fast. parallel computations.

    <details class="doc_details"><summary>DDE User Interface for HCA</summary>
        The HCA UI reuses components of the DDE user interface
        for those opperations that are in common with
        normal DDE editing.

            <li>Choosing <select style="background-color:#93dfff"><option>HCA</option></select> from the Editor pane's view menu, shows the HCA

            <li>Choosing <select style="background-color:#93dfff"><option>JS</option><option>HCA</option></select> from the Editor pane's view menu, while viewing HCA,
                writes out HCA JSON to the editor pane, with the help of a dialog box
                to give you options on what Object Definitions to put into the text editor pane.</li>
            <li>Clicking <button>Eval</button> with JSON in the editor pane will <i>inspect</i>
                the JSON, particularly useful for the large amount of JSON generated by HCA,
                to make it easier to understand the hierarchy.</li>

                at the top of the Doc pane to search for HCA definitions.
                The results are shown in the inspector for direct matches, search term included in
                name, and definitons containing calls having the search term as their name.</li>

                  any other JavaScript data structures.
                  While inspecting an Object defintion, a button in the inspector header
                  lets you edit that Object defintion.
                  While inspecting a Call, a button in the inspector header lets you
                  edit its containing Object definition, centering and selecting
                  the Call block.</li>
