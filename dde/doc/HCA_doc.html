<div style="color:red;">The HCA UI is a work in progress, not yet ready for practical use.</div>
HCA stands for Heterogeneous Computing Architecture. HCA_UI is a user interface
    to writing software for Dexter's FPGA, using a graphical editor.
    The tool creates a JSON representation of the layout of the objects in the editor.
    That JSON representation is sent to a compiler that makes a compiled gateware file which
    is stored on Dexter and controls the computation of the FPGA.
    That gateware can move Dexter's joints, captures joint positions
    from the optical sensor on each joint and perform additional
    very fast. parallel computations.

    <details class="doc_details"><summary>DDE User Interface for HCA</summary>
        The HCA UI reuses components of the DDE user interface
        for those opperations that are in common with
        normal DDE editing.

            <li>Clicking <button>Eval</button> with JSON in the editor pane will <i>inspect</i>
                the JSON, particularly useful for the large amount of JSON generated by HCA,

                at the top of the Doc pane to search for HCA definitions.
                The results are shown in the inspector for direct matches, search term included in

                  While inspecting an Object defintion, a button in the inspector header
                  lets you edit that Object defintion.
                  While inspecting a Call, a button in the inspector header lets you
                  edit its containing Object definition, centering and selecting

        The top of the column has a <b>Simulator</b> control which is not yet operational.
        <br/><br/>
        The <b>Wires</b> control give you 3 options for how wires are drawn
            between outputs and inputs of blocks. Changing this has no effect on
            computation, but may improve understanding of your network depending
            on its layout.
        <br/><br/>
        <button>Inspect Info</button> gives you comprehensive access to internal data
                 structures. This <i>may</i> help in debugging, but more valuable is the
                 less comprehensive, more targeted data Inspection shown when you click on

        <b>FPGA Type</b> gives the HCA compiler a hint to optimize what it produces
           for different FPGA chips. This does not affect the HCA user interface
           in any other way.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>Dataset Tree</b> allows you to explore the numerous data types available.
           Clicking on one gives you a dialog box of operations on the selected Dataset
        <br/><br/>
        <b>Object Tree</b> allows you to explore the numerous object definitions available.
        Clicking on one gives you a dialog box of operations on the selected object.
        The most useful operation is making a call to that definition.
        The 2nd most useful operation is viewing (and editing) the definition itself.
