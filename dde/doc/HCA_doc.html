<div style="font-color:red;">The HCA UI is a work in progress, not ready for use.</div>
HCA stands for Heterogeneous Computing Architecture. HCA_UI is a user interface
    to writing software for FPGA's using a graphical editor.
    The tool creates a JSON representation of the layout of the objects in the editor.
    That JSON representation is sent to a compiler that makes a compiled gateware file which
    is stored on Dexter and controls the computation of the FPGA.
    That computation moves Dexter's joints and captures joint positions
    from the optical sensor on each joint.
    <p></p>
    HCA_UI reuses components of the DDE user interface
    for those opperations that are in common with
    normal DDE editing.
    When the HCA UI is brought up, it replaces the editor section of
    DDE's editor pane with a Boxes-and-Lines graph editor.

<details class="doc_details"><summary>HCA editor operations</summary>
<ul>
    <li> <b>drag a node</b> to move it.</li>
    <li> <b>click a node</b> to select it.</li>
    <li> <b>ctrl-a</b> select all nodes.</li>
    <li> <b>ctrl-x</b> cut the selected nodes.</li>
    <li> <b>ctrl-c</b> copy the selected nodes to the clipboard.</li>
    <li> <b>ctrl-v</b> paste the selected nodes from the clipboard.</li>
</ul>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>DDE Menu items for HCA</summary>
<ul>
    <li><b>File menu/New</b> Clears the canvas of all nodes and starts a "new buffer".</li>
    <li><b>File menu/Open ...</b> Allows the user to select a file from the computer's file system
        to edit.</li>
    <li><b>File menu/Load ...</b> Allows the user to select a file to load, which creates
        buttons of definitions of nodes. Clicking a button creates an instance
        of that definition, populating the canvas with nodes.</li>
    <li><b>File menu/Save</b> Saves the current file being edited (as a big JSON string).</li>
    <li><b>File menu/Save as ...</b>  Lets the user choose a file to save the currently
        being edited nodes.</li>
    <li><b>Edit menu/pretty print</b>  arranges the nodes to be well spaced.</li>
</ul>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Other DDE UI for HCA</summary>
    <b>Files menu</b> (select of recently used files)
       If you select a file without
       valid HCA code, it errors but leaves the current canvas and fikes menu unchanged.
    <p></p>
    <b>Eval button</b>
    <ul>
        <li>If no selection, inspect the HCA class itself.</li>
        <li>If one selected node, inspect it.</li>
        <li>If more than one selected node, inspect an array of those selected nodes.</li>
    </ul>
