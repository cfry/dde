__________DDE4 Install on Dexter____________
DDE4 requires an updated version of Node (v 16) to be on your Dexter.
First check to see if you need the new version of node:
- In a Terminal
  - Type in: ssh root@192.168.1.142  (or your Dexter's IP address)
     When prompted, enter Password:  klg

  - Type in: node --version
       (old versions of Node 11 should be updated to version 16
       via the below instructions)

- Browse: nodejs.org/dist/v16.13.1/
  click:  node-v16.13.1-linux-ppc64le.tar.xz
  This is for Dexter's arm71 processor. Its 17Mbytes. Now in fry downloads folder.

- Untar this file. (On Mac, double click it)
   You can Launch a Terminal app:
       - Type in: cd Downloads
       - Type in: tar -xJvf node-v16.13.1-linux-armv7l.tar.xz

- Copy the file to your Dexter:
   - On Mac, use cyberduck  (or some other transfer app)
      to copy dowloads/node-v16.13.1-linux-armv7l/bin/node
              to Dexter /usr/bin/node

- In a Terminal

  - chmod node --reference=node_11  to fix up executable permissions to
        those permissions of the previous version of node
        which should be: -rwxr-xr-x

The Node server requires 2 extra npm packages:
formidable  and ModbusRTU, but these should
already be on your Dexter.
