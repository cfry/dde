     This section lists the significant problems we are aware of
with this DDE release. All of them are on our "do list".
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li> The simulator works for measured_angles, but for many of the other joint metrics,
       it does not.</li>
  <li>The Messaging software is not yet intended for public use. We're still testing.</li>
  <li>Jobs menu/Run Jobs on Dexter will take some work to get it to operate smoothly.
      You'll also need a new SD card image on your Dexter.</li>
   <li>Picture.detect_blobs: the data about each blob is inconsistent with
       itself. detect_blobs <i>appears</i> to work but actual x, y locations
       for each blob are wrong.</li>
   <li>Picture.show_video() sometimes comes up with a blank video, not showing the
       output of your webcam. Often just closing the show_window that is attempting
       to display the video and starting over will work.
       This intermittent problem also occurs when calling Picture.take_picture
       which needs webcam output.</li>
    <!-- not sure this is really needed with the new timeout<li>Do not attempt to run a Job while Dexter is in the process of booting.
        Wait for its "dance" to be over. </li> -->
    <li>Speech Recognition is busted.</li>
    <li>The new subsystems in DDE of ezTeach to_source_code, OpenCV, and
        Drawing with DXF are works in progress. They need better support,
        and their API may change.</li>
    <li>Dexter Kinematics article in doc pane is incomplete.</li>
    <li>None of the apps for the 3 platforms are "signed", thus you get warnings
        when installing them about being "untrusted". You might have
        to turn off virus protection, or click right on the
        <code>dexter_dev_env</code> file to launch it.
    </li>
    <li>Linux release poorly tested.</li>
    <li>Dexter.run_gcode needs many extensions.</li>
</ul>
