`//////// Job Example 1
//A Job is esssentially a named list of instructions to
//be executed by a robot. There are several different
//formats for instructions. The most general is a
//function defintion. Below you can define a simple job
//with a name and 2 instructions by
//holding down the 'alt' key and clicking on 'new'.
//This will select the Job definition.
//With that selected, click the Eval button.
new Job({
    name: "my_job",

        IO.out("first instruction"),  //will cause 'first instruction' to be printed in output pane when run
        function(){out("2nd instruction")} //This function will be called
    ]}) 
   
//Now click the Output pane's Clear button.
//Hold down the 'alt' key and click on 'my_job'
//to select this call to 'start'.
//Click the Eval button.               
Job.my_job.start() //Start running 'my_job'
//Scroll to the top of the Output pane.
//You will see 'Starting job", followed by
//the results of calling the two function instructions
//followed by details of the job's ending state,
//including status_code: "completed" if all goes well.

`/*      Job Example 2 
move_all_joints takes 5 angles in degrees, one for each 
of Dexter's joints.
move_to takes an xyz position (in meters from Dexter's base),
where you want the end effect to end up.
Beware, the 2nd and 3rd args to move_to determine the ending
J5_direction and which way the joints go. 
These are tricky to get right.

`/*     Job Example 9 Async Instructions
Using "dont_call_set_up_next_do"
 Normally when a function in JS is called, it
 executes the code in its body and returns 
 (possibly with a value computed by the body).
 These are called "Synchronous Functions".
 But some functions, particularly ones that take a long time
 to run (ie hundreds of milliseconds or more) or are 
 performed on other computers such as a Dexter, are 
 designed to return immediately when called, but then 
 the real work of the function goes on behind the scenes. 
 These are called "Asynchronous Functions".
 Often such functions take an argument
 that is a "callback function" that is called when 
 the real work of the function ends. 
 
 If you want to call such a function,
 and wait until its done, before calling another function,
 you can't simply place calls to the functions
 one after the other as in normal code, because 
 the 2nd one will start executing right after the 
 immediate return of the first,
 not when the "real work" of the 1st is done.

 An example of such a function is "beep" 
 (supplied in DDE, but not normal JS). 
 First try a call to beep:
 */
beep({frequency: 440})
/*ok now select two calls to beep at once before hitting "Eval".*/
beep({frequency: 440, dur: 1})
beep({frequency: 500, dur: 2})
/*notice that the first call returns immediately and the
 2nd call is executing while the first beep is still beeping
 thus playing a 2 note chord.
 (We've extending the duration of the 2nd note to have it
 continue beyond the first to make the chord more obvious.

 OK playing chords is nice but what if you want to play a melody,
 ie one note AFTER the first has completed? 
 One approach is to use the "callback when done" for the first.
 */
beep({frequency: 330, callback: beep})
//and if we want to call that 2nd beep with other than its default args.
beep({frequency: 330, callback: function(){beep({frequency: 220})}})
/*this nesting trick can be played again by using the callback
 arg of the 2nd beep to place a 3rd beep, etc.
 But notice the code starts to get hard to read as the nesting
 level goes up.

 However, this problem is what the Job's do_list is 
 designed to solve. We define a function that calls 
 a method that returns immediatly but has a callback 
 to call when done. Our callback calls set_up_next_do, 
 which causes the do_list program counter to increment 
 and then execute the next instruction on the do_list.
 But to avoid the job code itself calling set_up_next_do as it
 usually does, we have to turn off that call by returning
 "dont_call_set_up_next_do" to avoid calling it twice
 for the same instrution.*/
function my_waiting_beeper(){
    var job_instance = this
    beep({dur: 1, callback: function(){job_instance.set_up_next_do()}})
    return "dont_call_set_up_next_do"
}
/* Now our Job definition can just list 2 references to the

`/* Job Example 10 Serial Port
   Connections between different devices are often problematic,
   because this is much more complex than most programmers expect.
   Your most useful trait is persistence! 

  This walks you though controlling an Arduino board from DDE.
  If you haven't used Arduino before,
  1. Download the Arduino IDE from https://www.arduino.cc, SOFTWARE tab,
  2. Launch it, 
  3. Choose Help menu/Getting Started, and do what it says including:
  4. Connect your Arduino board to your computer via a USB cable.
  The green power light on the board should go on.
  Now get info on the connected hardware (low level, doesn't need Jobs/Robots)

//Use one of the returned "comName" paths like so:
var ard_path = last(serial_devices()).comName // something like: 
               //"/dev/tty.usbmodem1411"

//Now we are going to install a program into your Arduino.
//In the Arduino App, choose File menu/new and paste in:
/*

    Serial.begin(9600);
    pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);
    digitalWrite(LED, LOW);  // Turn LED off

//In the Arduino IDE, click the upload button, annoying labeled as a right arrow.
//This should cause the orange light on the Arduino to flash briefly signifying

//If the upload fails, you'll see red text in the Arduino IDE output pane.
//Try unplugging and replugging your USB cable and uploading again.
//After success, connect to the device
serial_connect_low_level(ard_path) //returns lots of info including the path

//Now we're ready to use DDE's Job software to control our Arduino.
//First, you may want to programmatically upload a file into Arduino from DDE.
//When the Arduino IDE uploads a file to Arduino, it first compiles the
//file in to a .hex file. It is this .hex file that is actually uploaded.
//The clever authors of the Arduino IDE made finding this file challenging.
//https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=131655.0 tells you how to do it
//for Windows, but not the Mac.
//Move that file to under your dde_apps folder and use:
serial_send_low_level(read_file("some_arduino_file.ino.hex"), ard_path)
//please let us know if this works, esp. if you're on a Mac.
//If you can't get programmatic file upload into your Arduino,
//just use the Arduion app, paste the code into the editor,
//and click the right arrow to upload your Arduino code manually.
