<details class="doc_details" id="hca_ui_doc_id"><summary>HCA User Interface</summary>
This interface to a graph editor for creating FPGA code is
quite preliminary and far from ready for productive work,
but shows one possible approach.
<p></p>
It reuses DDE user interface
elements for those opperations that are in common with
normal DDE editing.
    When the HCA UI is brought up, it replaces the editor section of
    DDE's editor pane with a graph editor.
<p></p>
The editor is only available via a secret incantation,
not accessible in released DDE.


<details class="doc_details"><summary>HCA editor keystrokes</summary>
<ul>
    <li> <b>ctrl-a</b> select all nodes.</li>
    <li> <b>ctrl-x</b> cut the selected nodes.</li>
    <li> <b>ctrl-c</b> copy the selected nodes to the clipboard.</li>
    <li> <b>ctrl-v</b> paste the selected nodes from the clipboard.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>DDE Menu items for HCA</summary>
<ul>
    <li><b>File menu/New</b> Clears the canvas of all nodes and starts a "new buffer".</li>
    <li><b>File menu/Open ...</b> Allows the user to select a file from the computer's file system
        to edit.</li>
    <li><b>File menu/Load ...</b> Allows the user to select a file to load, which creates
        buttons of definitions of nodes. Clicking a button creates an instance
        of that definition, populating the canvas with nodes.</li>
    <li><b>File menu/Save</b> Saves the current file being edited (as a big JSON string).</li>
    <li><b>File menu/Save as ...</b>  Lets the user choose a file to save the currently
        being edited nodes.</li>
    <li><b>Edit menu/pretty print</b>  arranges the nodes to be well spaced.</li>
</ul>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Other DDE UI for HCA</summary>
    <b>Files menu</b> (select of recently used files)
       If you select a file without
       valid HCA code, it errors but leaves the current canvas and fikes menu unchanged.
    <p></p>
    <b>Eval button</b>
    <ul>
        <li>If no selection, inspect the HCA class itself.</li>
        <li>If one selected node, inspect it.</li>
        <li>If more than one selected node, inspect an array of those selected nodes.</li>
    </ul>
