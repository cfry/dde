    The most flexible way is to use JavaScript and
    DDE's JS libraries.

    or are new to JavaScript, you're in the right place.`],

        <li>select <b>New</b></li>
    </ol>to give us an empty editor.`,

    useful examples of JavaScript code into the editor.<br/>

     Its tooltip explains what is <i>possibly</i> wrong.
