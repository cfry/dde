<h3>Dexter Glossary</h3>
The most useful terms for the Dexter platform.

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Automatic Tool Changer (ATC)</summary>
A "Hand" that mounts on the end of Dexter's last link that
can grab any end-effector that has a cooresponding ATC handle.
This enables Dexter to easily grab many different end-effectors.
Dexter's ATC can pass both electrical signals and power
to an end-effector, and receive electrical signals from
sensors in an end-effector.
</details>
<details class="doc_details"><summary>arcsecond</summary>
A unit of angle, meaning one 3600th of a degree. This is about
the resolution of a Dexter joint. There are 1,296,000 arcseconds in 360 degrees.
</details>
<details class="doc_details"><summary>Cartesian Coordinate System</summary>
</details>
<details class="doc_details"><summary>config (for Dexter's joint angles)</summary>
The position of Dexter's end effector does not fully describe its physical state.
There can be several different ways in which Dexter's joints can be bent to
arrive at an end position, and the <i>config</i> determines that. It is an array
of 3 integers, all either 0 or 1. The first number means LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1).
The second means DOWN (0) or UP (1).
The third means IN (0) or OUT (1).
See the Reference Manual for Dexter.move_to for more info.
</details>
<details class="doc_details"><summary>do_list</summary>
    The property of a Job instance that holds the array of <b>instruction</b>s
    to be executed by the <b>Job</b>. Usually the instructions are run
    in order, though various control instructions can skip over,
    conditionally run, or even loop through, do_list items.
    The do_list is the essence of a Job.
</details>
<details class="doc_details"><summary>end-effector</summary>
A tool held by Dexter for performing a specific function such as
a gripper for holding things or a laser for cutting things.
See ATC.
</details>
<details class="doc_details"><summary>instruction</summary>
    Generally, an item on a <b>Job</b>'s <b>do_list</b> describing a
    small action such as <code>Dexter.move_to</code> a location.
    Some do_list items are literally an instance of DDE's <i>Instruction</i> class,
    while others, like functions and arrays, are common JavaScript types.
</details>
<details class="doc_details"><summary>Job</summary>
    The data structure that describes the process of making (or doing) something.
    Jobs have many properties, all of which have defaults. 
    The most important ones are:
    <ul><li><b>name</b></li>
        <li><b>do_list</b></li>
        <li><b>robot</b></li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details class="doc_details"><summary>J5_direction</summary>
An array of 2 or 3 numbers that indicates the orientation of Dexter's joint 5 (or its last link).
See the Reference Manual for Dexter.move_to for more info.
</details>
<details class="doc_details"><summary>kinemetics</summary>
    The relationship between the joint angles and the position
    of a robot. Forward kinematics is the computation for tranforming
    joint angles into end effector location (in Cartesian coorinates).
    Inverse kinematics is the computation for tranforming Cartesian
    coordinates of an end effector into joint angles. These
    computations are complex, especially for Robots with
    5 or more axes.
</details>
<details class="doc_details"><summary>micron</summary>
A unit of length, meaning one milionth of a meter.
</details>
<details class="doc_details"><summary>pose</summary>
A 4 x 4 matrix of numbers used to efficiently describe Dexter's physical state.
</details>
<details class="doc_details"><summary>position</summary>
A 3 x 3 matrix of numbers describing Dexter's state.
The first row is the <b>xyz</b> location of the end effector.
The second row is the <b>J5_direction</b> of the end effector.
the thrid row is the <b>config</b>.
</details>
<details class="doc_details"><summary>robot</summary>
    A machine that can execute instructions. The fundamental definition
    of a robot is its <b>instruction</b> set, i.e. the instructions that
    it is capable of executing. A <b>Job</b> feeds instructions from its <b>do_list</b>
    to its robot to run.
</details>
<details class="doc_details"><summary>SI Units</summary>
The International scientific units standard.
Generally, Dexter uses these except for angles
instead of the SI radians, we use degrees. DDE has
a easy way to convert numbers between different units.
</details>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>xyz</summary>
A location expressed as a 3 element array of numbers
in cartesian coordinates. Often xyz refers to the
location of Dexter's end effector relative to
the location of joint 1. If you are behind Dexter with its processor board to the right,
positive X is to your right, positive Y is straight ahead, and postive Z is up.
