JOB ENGINE
The Job Engine is a way to run Jobs created by DDE
without the development environment.
It lacks editing, debugging and help facilities,
but is *much* smaller and requires much fewer
computer resources and libraries.

IMPLEMENTATION
The Job Engine is comprised of the DDE folders:
core and math. It has one extra file not used by DDE:
core/index.js
The code in that file is used to initialize the Job Engine
and start a job.

TO RUN A JOB:
 In a Terminal/Shell window:
 - cd to electron_dde (DDE's main code dir, contains the dir 'core') and enter:
 - node core define_and_start_job /Users/Fry/Documents/dde_apps/node_test_job.js
 where the file is one that contains:
 new Job(...)
 Use DDE to learn how to define Jobs.

 This should:
 - define the job
 - start that job
 - run it to completion
 - exit node
 During this, you should see in the terminal window lots of printouts telling you
 of progress.

SIMULATION
 Doing the above the first time will run Jobs with:
 simulate=true
 meaning that Dexter won't move when a move instruction is run.
 to get Dexter to move, the Dexter robot instance must have
 its simulate arg set to false, i.e. in dde_init.js:
 new Dexter({name: "dexter0", simulate: false})

 To make simulate=false be the default for all
 subsequently defined DEXTER'S, add to dde_init.js:
 DB_DDE.persistent_set("default_dexter_simulate", false)
 You'd have to stick this line in dde_init before
 the definition of any Dexter's for it to affect them.
 Once this is done, each time you boot DDE or the job_engine,
 the default for simulate will be false.

CUSTOMIZING JOB ENGINE JOBS
When you 'run a job' as defined above,
it sets window.platform to "node".
If you are in dde, window.platform == "dde".
That means you can customize any code written
based on this "platform" i.e.
if(window.platform == "node")      { console.log("hey I'm in node.") }
else if (window.platform == "dde") { console.log("we're in dde!") }

The system software takes advantage of this.
One important case is that the "out" function is defined as:
function out(val="", color="black", temp=false, code=null){
    if(window.platform == "node") { console.log(val) }
    else { //do formatting and print to DDE's Output pane
    }
}
Thus when running on node, 'out' only pays attention to its
first arg. It sends the first arg directly to the console.
